	//
	// History, because the comment would otherwise read as superstition: until
	// #816, keys.PrefixUpperBound incremented the first sub-0xFF byte from the
	// right and returned WITHOUT clearing the trailing 0xFF bytes, so for a
	// 25-byte 0x25|ws|src prefix whose last byte was 0xFF it admitted keys
	// belonging to the NEXT source id. The loop below increments from the right
	// and ZEROES every byte it wraps, which is why it was correct when the
	// shared helper was not. #816 made the helper carry-and-truncate, so the two
	// now agree (the helper is marginally tighter — it drops the zeroed tail
	// rather than writing it).
	//
	// It stays hand-rolled anyway. This loop has NO per-key prefix check, so its
	// bound is its ONLY protection, and it is the one scan here that both
	// deletes and MINTS. A bound whose correctness is visible in the ten lines
	// above the loop it protects is worth more here than consistency with the
	// four guarded call sites — those degrade to an extra comparison if a helper
	// regresses; this one fabricates edges.
	//
	// This is the FIFTH scan over the 0x25|ws|src prefix and the only one held
	// inside its keyspace by its bound alone: the candidate loop below has no
	// bytes.Equal(k[:25], prefix) break, unlike the four sites listed in the
	// STO-11 census. A loose bound here does not merely over-delete — the restore
	// loop MINTS live 0x03/0x04/0x14 rows, so it would fabricate a victim →
	// neighbour's-dst edge that never existed and stamp restoredAt on it, which
	// permanently exempts it from GCArchivedEdges. The engramExists(ws, c.dst)
	// guard below does NOT catch that: the neighbour's dst is a real live engram.
	// The liveness predicate and the bound are orthogonal.

//
// RestoreArchivedEdges has always replicated its restore batch, so this is not
// a new replicated write on the read path — but it is the first DESTRUCTIVE
// one, and a follower reaches it independently of the leader. On a follower,
// recall locally deletes 0x25 rows the leader may still hold, until the leader
// recalls the same source and ships the same deletion.
//
// Judged not a correctness problem, on two grounds. First, the rows are
// PROVABLY unrestorable: RestoreArchivedEdges is the only reader of a 0x25
// prefix, it requires the source's 0x01 record, and that record is gone — so
// the divergence is between "absent" and "present but unreadable by anything",
// which no query can distinguish. Second, it is self-limiting: one commit per
// source, after which the prefix is empty and every later call finds n == 0 and
// commits nothing. It cannot oscillate and it cannot amplify.
//
// What it is NOT is a claim about the replication model in general. If a
// follower's local deletes are supposed to be impossible rather than merely
// harmless, this is the call site to change, and the fix is to gate the reap on
// leadership and let followers skip (paying the rescan) rather than to make the
// reap conditional on some weaker signal. Stated here so that review is a
// question about one function, not an archaeology exercise.
