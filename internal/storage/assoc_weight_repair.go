// RepairLegacyFullWeightAssocKeys relocates pre-fix weight-1.0 association keys
// from the weight-0.0 key position they were written at to the true 1.0
// position, and reports how many pairs it moved.
//
// # What is being repaired
//
// A pre-fix full-confidence edge (decide's evidence links, an explicit 1.0
// link, LTP saturation) sits at complement 0xFFFFFFFF and therefore READS as
// weight 0. Its 0x14 weight index, which always stored raw float bits and was
// never affected by the encoder bug, still says 1.0. That disagreement — key
// position 0.0, index exactly 1.0 — is the disambiguator, and it is what makes
// the repair unambiguous rather than a guess.
//
// # The rule
//
// For every 0x03 key at complement 0xFFFFFFFF, read the pair's 0x14 index:
//
//   - index == exactly 1.0 → pre-fix full-weight edge. Rewrite fwd (0x03) and
//     rev (0x04) at the 1.0 position carrying the value bytes VERBATIM, delete
//     the legacy-position keys. The 0x14 index is left untouched: it was always
//     right, and rewriting it would be the one way this pass could lose data.
//   - anything else → left alone. It is a genuine weight-0-ish edge, or an
//     orphan some other mechanism owns. The repair never guesses.
//
// # Repair window (this is why the pass runs early)
//
// A decay pass over an unrepaired vault destroys the disambiguator, per the
// #756 correction. Decay reads oldW=0 from the key and then either
//
//   - deletes the edge outright, index included (legacy 18-byte values, whose
//     peakWeight decodes as 0 → bootstrap peak 0 → dynamicFloor 0 → remove), or
//   - clamps it to peak*0.05, REWRITING 0x14 to 0.05 and moving the keys
//     (modern values, whose peakWeight is 1.0).
//
// After either, the edge is byte-indistinguishable from an honestly-earned
// 0.05 edge (or gone). Those edges are NOT counted as skipped or unrepairable
// below, because they cannot be identified at all — claiming a count for them
// would be inventing one.
//
// The same silence covers a second, older cohort: an association written before
// the 0x14 weight index existed carries no index record at all, so
// rawAssocWeightIndex reads 0, the pair fails the "exactly 1.0" test and is
// skipped. If such a pair was a full-weight edge, the repair cannot tell it
// apart from a genuine weight-0 edge and will not guess — it is uncounted for
// the same reason, absence of evidence rather than a decision.
//
// # Multi-key pairs
//
// WriteAssociation performs no cleanup on rewrite, so one pair can hold several
// 0x03 keys at different weights. The scan is therefore key-driven, not
// pair-driven, and never assumes a pair has exactly one key. Two consequences,
// both deliberate:
//
//   - If a pair ALREADY has a key at the true 1.0 position, that key wins: the
//     legacy key is deleted and the surviving key's value bytes are left alone.
//     Overwriting it with the legacy value would roll back whatever wrote the
//     correctly-placed one.
//   - Keys the pair holds at OTHER weights are not touched. They are pre-existing
//     duplicates from WriteAssociation's no-cleanup rewrite, not damage this bug
//     caused, and inventing a garbage collector for them here would let a repair
//     delete edges on evidence it never checked.
//
// # Atomicity and funding
//
// The iterator's snapshot is fixed at creation, so chunked commits are safe:
// every legacy key is visited exactly once and the relocated keys this pass
// writes (complement 0x00000000, which sorts BEFORE the legacy position) are
// invisible to it. Work is bounded per batch by assocWeightRepairChunkSize and
// the whole pass is one-shot per vault behind the 0x2E watermark.
//
// # The capture→commit window, and why the snapshot is not enough
//
// That same fixed snapshot is a hazard, not only a convenience: a pair captured
// from it can be superseded by a LIVE write before the chunk commits. The case
// that matters is Hebbian UpdateAssocWeight, which reads 1.0 from the 0x14
// index, deletes both the correct and the legacy key positions, and rewrites
// the pair at (say) 0.8. Committing the captured snapshot value on top of that
// resurrects a phantom full-weight edge that sorts FIRST in GetAssociations
// while the index says 0.8, and nothing afterwards ever deletes it.
//
// So flushChunk re-validates every pair against the LIVE db immediately before
// writing, and the probe is the right question — is the legacy key still there:
//
//   - legacy fwd key absent → someone else already moved or removed this pair.
//     Skip it entirely, emitting no Sets AND no Deletes.
//   - legacy fwd key present → re-read the 0x14 index and require exactly 1.0
//     again, and carry the FRESHLY-READ legacy value bytes, never the captured
//     ones, so a concurrent in-place rewrite of that value is not clobbered.
//
// This narrows the window; it does not close it. There is a real residual
// between the probe and the batch commit, because association writes are not
// taken under casLocks (that lock set covers engram confidence/delete paths) and
// this repair does not invent a new lock regime for them. What survives is a
// microsecond-scale window instead of a whole-scan-length one, and the pass runs
// at startup where concurrent Hebbian traffic is at its thinnest. Naming it is
// the honest description; calling it impossible would not be.
//
// # Replication
//
// Nothing here is shipped to followers. The repair is deterministic and
// idempotent, so every node reaches the same state by running it locally —
// matching the #681 evolve-repair precedent. See the upgrade-ordering note on
// Engine.runLegacyFullWeightAssocRepair for the two rolling-upgrade residuals
// that choice leaves.
