// entitiesArrayDescription and entityItemsSchema define THE MIDDLE GEAR between
// a bare muninn_remember(content) — ~20 tokens, no concept, no entities, and
// invisible to every entity-based tool — and a fully-declared write, which costs
// roughly 8x the content in JSON. Measured on a 4,216-engram corpus, only 4.81%
// of writes carried any declaration and 29.9% carried an entity, because under
// time pressure the cheap path is the path taken.
//
// Two cheaper gears, in ascending order of cheapness:
//
//   - a BARE STRING name: ["PostgreSQL","Auth Service"]. The server resolves the
//     type from the vault's own entity table (see entityTypeResolver). ~15 extra
//     tokens for a whole entity set.
//   - [[markup]] in the content itself: ~2 tokens per entity, no JSON at all.
//
// The object form is unchanged and still wins wherever it is supplied: a
// declared type is never substituted (principle #1). `type` is deliberately NOT
// required — requiring it is the same class of client-side hard rejection the
// type enum was, where a caller who could not classify an entity dropped the
// whole entity, and that cost ~64pp of measured entity coverage.
const entitiesArrayDescription = "Entities mentioned in this memory. Providing these skips background entity extraction. " +

	// normalizeEntityType coerces any unrecognised value to "other" on every
