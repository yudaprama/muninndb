// tool_classification_test.go — the drift gate for MCP tool mode enforcement.
//
// #731 happened because muninn_state sat in the read-only bucket while its
// handler wrote (handleState → mcpEngineAdapter.UpdateState →
// Engine.UpdateLifecycleState). Every test in the suite still passed:
//
//   - TestToolClassification_CoversAllRegisteredHandlers proved only that each
//     tool sits in exactly ONE bucket, never that the bucket is the right one.
//   - The per-mode dispatch loops SELECTED their tools with the very predicate
//     they were meant to police (`if !isReadOnlyTool(name) { continue }`), so a
//     wrong bucket made them assert the vulnerability instead of catching it.
//     Reverting muninn_state to read-only left all four GREEN.
//   - The two hand-typed lists in auth_mk_test.go were not exhaustive, and had
//     silently drifted: the mutating list named 16 of the 23 tools the
//     classifier then covered — 7 omissions, none of which any test noticed.
//     (Those 7 plus muninn_state, newly mutating, are the 8 names #732 adds.)
//
// The gate below replaces all of that with a census, in the shape SEC-15's
// TestAppendMode_MethodCensus established: a per-tool decision a human must
// record, checked against the registry in BOTH directions and against all
// three predicates. Deliberately NO length comparisons anywhere — comparing
// counts between two hand-maintained lists passes happily when both drift the
// same way, which is the trap that made registeredToolNames() useless as a
// cross-check before it was derived from toolHandlers().
