// #712 / #716 / COG-25 — recall-time version-cluster ADVISORY annotation.
//
// This is a HIGH-PRECISION HINT, never an authority: no mechanical signal can
// prove "B replaces A" vs "B supplements A" (that is a judgment about the
// world), so this phase only ever ANNOTATES (possibly_superseded_by /
// version_cluster / newest_of_cluster) — it never changes a Score, never
// removes or demotes a result, never writes, and never fires on a pair that
// already carries an explicit RelSupersedes edge (the asserted signal always
// wins over the inferred one). The only ordering change is a reorder of
// EXACT score ties within a single detected cluster, newest-
// EffectiveValidFrom-first — global ordering, and all other tiebreaks, are
// untouched.
//
// REVISION 2 (this file): the v1 gate (entity-or-RelRefines anchor + a
// cosine >= 0.83 discriminator) was measured against a real sample
// vault (#716) and failed to fire: the widgetflow version chain carries ZERO
// extracted entities (the vault is entity-sparse generally) and no
// RelRefines edges (the novelty cache was cold), so the anchor gate was
// permanently false; and offline cosines over the real content showed
// version-chain pairs (0.75-0.92) OVERLAPPING coexisting-variant pairs
// (0.68-0.86) by 0.11 — cosine cannot discriminate this data (worst case:
// "final v3 structure" <-> "telemetry fee tiered v2" = 0.86, a false
// pair). Tags carry the real signal on this vault (and, per its measured
// structure, on tag-organized vaults generally): a TAG ANCHOR (shared
// non-ubiquitous topic tags + differing version-marker tags + no
// facet-conflict tag) replaces cosine as the discriminator; cosine survives
// only as a loose sanity floor (see currencySimThreshold, demoted from 0.83
// to 0.70). Entity/RelRefines anchors are KEPT as additional-when-present
// (harmless on entity-sparse vaults — they just rarely fire).

	// currencySimThreshold is now a loose SANITY FLOOR, not the

// the entire evidentiary basis for telling an agent that a live fact might be
// stale. A supersession advisory with no version vocabulary on either side is
// not a weak hint; it is a guess dressed as evidence.
