// applyVersionHeadSubstitution is COG-28 (#763): if a query's evidence reached
// ANY member of a DECLARED version chain with admission-worthy strength, recall
// resolves that evidence to the chain's authoritative current head before
// ranking, and says so.
//
// THE BUG IT CLOSES is an ordering bug, not a scoring one. EvolveAt
// soft-deletes its predecessor, but nothing removes that predecessor from HNSW
// or FTS — its vector and its postings are exactly the ones the user's OLD
// wording matches. Phase 6's lifecycle cut then discards it before it is ever
// scored, so its earned relevance is thrown away rather than redirected, and
// applySupersession (which already injects an absent head for the VISIBLE stale
// case) can never see it. When the rewrite changed the vocabulary, a query
// phrased against the old wording reaches only the predecessor and the current
// truth is stored, current, and invisible.
//
// THE SPLIT. Phase 6 keeps the evidence — it is the only place with the query
// embedding, the corpus IDF statistics and the abstention formula, so it scores
// the refused predecessor with the SAME functions at the SAME threshold and
// emits it as an activation.ShadowMatch (Activations stays byte-identical).
// This phase resolves and injects — it is the only place with
// reverse-association reads, the visibility gate and resolveSupersessionHead,
// which already implements every chain-walk property #763 asks for. No new
// scoring math is invented anywhere.
//
// HONESTY RULES, all mandatory:
//   - The head ranks at the PREDECESSOR's Final. That is not a new idea: it is
//     the doctrine already written into applySupersession — "the score belongs
//     to the TOPIC, and the head is the correct answer for it" — extended to
//     the case where the stale member happens to be invisible. Re-scoring the
//     head against the query instead would gate the successor on wording it
//     deliberately no longer has, reproducing the bug one layer deeper; an
//     ε-discount would be a silent statement that we trust the author's
//     declaration less than we say we do.
//   - ScoreComponents are the predecessor's real measurements, verbatim, and
//     the substituted_for / substitution_basis attribution that says so is NOT
//     optional. Under include_why the Why string leads with it in plain
//     language.
//   - The ONLY admission path is a predecessor that cleared req.Threshold on
//     the unchanged formula with the tag-pool bypass explicitly disabled.
//     Substitution REDIRECTS admission-worthy evidence; it never CREATES it.
//
// Runs immediately BEFORE applySupersession on the same clock, so a head
// injected here is an ordinary result row by the time that phase runs and a
// head that is itself further superseded gets the existing promote/demote
// treatment for free. Read-only: reverse-assoc, engram, lease and (only for an
// injected head) one embedding read. No writes, no reinforcement — a shadow
// never enters the activation log, so a superseded fact is not STRENGTHENED by
// having been matched.
