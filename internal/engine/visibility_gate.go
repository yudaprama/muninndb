// visibilityGate renders the caller's result-eligibility decision for
// post-pipeline injections: the six visibility predicates enumerated on
// Admits. Phase 6 applies the visibility contract to every scored candidate;
// anything appended to the result set afterwards must satisfy the same
// contract. The drift record shows what happens when each injector
// re-implements fragments of it instead — #654 (meta filters), the #570 review
// rounds (trust, then lease and valid-time), then the structured filter,
// missed by this gate's own first draft and caught in review: the contract
// lives partly in Filters and partly in request fields a predicate-over-
// filters cannot see, so any injector plumbed field-by-field is wrong by
// default the day a new field is added — and so is a gate that enumerates by
// memory. A new visibility field on ActivateRequest is part of THIS gate's
// contract at birth: add the predicate here, or the field is a bypass for
// every injector at once.
//
// The gate holds the resolved request and delegates each predicate to the same
// functions phase 6 calls; injectors submit candidates instead of carrying
// their own projection of the request, so a visibility field added to the
// contract is enforced here at birth rather than injector-by-injector.
//
// The gate covers visibility only. Whether an injector's evidence is strong
// enough to enter at all (entity boost's threshold comparison) and at what
// rank (supersession's corrective substitution) remain the injector's own
// semantics.

// to the same predicate functions phase 6 uses so the two paths cannot drift
// apart. The predicates are a pure conjunction, so ordering is a cost choice,
// not a semantic one: phase 6 interleaves them across its retrieval and
// scoring cuts, while the gate runs the cheap record-local checks first and
// the lease read (a store access) as late as possible.
//
// A lease read error fails CLOSED (the candidate is refused): phase 6 fails
// the whole request on the same fault, and silently admitting a
