// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PRE-REGISTERED ACCEPTANCE RULE FOR THE COGNITION TRIAL, AS CODE.
//
// Source of truth: .claude/deep-review/2026-08-02-cognition-trial-design.md §6,
// written before the first run. It is not moved after seeing numbers. Moving a
// threshold to rescue a result is tuning against the labeled set — principle #11
// — and the whole point of expressing the rule as code rather than prose is that
// a failing gate REPORTS ITSELF instead of being rounded up in a write-up.
//
// AMENDMENTS, all pre-registered in #798 BEFORE any number was produced, and
// each traceable to the clause that implements it:
//
//	D1  zero-relevance queries are EXCLUDED, COUNTED, and the power gates
//	    re-bind to the retained series (ctNDCGAt10's second return value,
//	    ctVaultFromSeries, U2's three new clauses, the census block)
//	D2  BASE-LEVEL-ONLY is added as a fifth arm; K2 gains Delta_HP and K4 was
//	    ORIGINALLY the veto on it (ctArmNames, K2, K4) — #798-A below deletes
//	    K4 as a verdict clause; K2's Delta_HP clause is the veto now
//	D3  S3 is DEMOTED to descriptive and leaves the SHIP conjunction
//	D4  KILL's actions are split by what evidence licenses them
//
// These are amendments to the RULE, not to a result: none was made after seeing
// an arm number, and each one only makes a conclusion harder to reach.
//
// #798-A / #798-B, pre-registered 2026-08-03 — BEFORE ANY DELTA EXISTED FOR
// ANY VAULT (every vault's honest ShuffledSeedNull was, and until #797/F1
// lands still is, ctNullNotRun). Amending the rule at that moment is
// pre-registration; amending it after numbers exist would be rigging the
// verdict, which is exactly what this whole file exists to make impossible.
//
//	#798-A  S6 (new, SHIP-side conjunct): the shuffled-seed null moves from K4
//	        (a KILL veto, where it was provably inert — every vault satisfying
//	        K4's predicate already satisfied K2's strictly weaker one, so
//	        ShuffledSeedNull was read by exactly one verdict-relevant line in
//	        the package and never changed a verdict) to S6, where the design
//	        (v2 §7.2(3)) always said a control against false positives
//	        belongs: at the positive claim, not the veto. K4 is DELETED from
//	        the KILL conjunction and retained only as a REPORT line that says,
//	        in its own text, that it decides nothing.
//	#798-B  K2's Delta_HP clause is RATIFIED as THE per-vault kill veto, at
//	        MinDeltaMechanism (0.02), unconditioned — not raised to MinDeltaC
//	        (0.03): Delta_HP is a mechanism quantity and belongs against the
//	        mechanism bar, not the whole prior's. Measured on the issue's own
//	        scenario, before any real Delta existed: the verdict flips KILL ->
//	        INCONCLUSIVE-BUT-POWERED exactly at Delta_HP = +0.02, with the
//	        (now-deleted) K4 predicate PASS at every point on the sweep — i.e.
//	        this clause was already doing the work #798-B asked a veto to do,
//	        unlabelled, 33% more strictly than the pre-registered bar.
//
// U7, #797's own analysis, same date, same pre-registration status (no Delta
// exists yet): a mechanism-delta series that is IDENTICALLY ZERO across its
// full length — the signature of phase4HebbianBoost's empty-activation-log
// short-circuit under the harness's ReadOnly runs, not a measured null — is
// typed as an ABSENCE OF MEASUREMENT and blocked from a K-clause vote the same
// way D1's empty-series guards block one. This does NOT close #797: the
// session-reconstruction repair, the I1-I6 census, and the permutation null
// are the real harness rebuild and remain open. U7 only stops an inert
// instrument from producing a verdict.
//
// D5, and it is a CORRECTION of D2 rather than a new amendment. D2 wired the
// NDCG-level ablation-additivity bounds in as a U3-class GATE. They cannot be
// one: they compare four POINT estimates with no interval, so under a null where
// the arms merely reorder results, Delta_H / Delta_P / Delta_HP are exchangeable,
// P(Delta_HP is the largest) = 1/3, and the lower bound is violated ~2/3 of the
// time BY CONSTRUCTION — measured at 92.5% / 90.7% / 91.8% / 92.7% for
// n = 320 / 1000 / 5000 / 20000. FLAT IN n: more data cannot fix it, which is the
// definition of a gate that is not an instrument check. End to end it produced
// UNDERPOWERED on 199 of 200 trials.
//
// And it could not simply be widened, because every violation DECODES TO A REAL
// WORLD: Delta_HP - Delta_C == NDCG(CONTENT-MATCH-ONLY) - NDCG(BASE-LEVEL-ONLY),
// so the upper bound breaks exactly when the ACT-R base-level prior is
// net-harmful, and the two lower-bound breaks decode the same way for each boost
// on top of it. The old comment here claimed the gate "suppresses a
// kill-supporting finding rather than a ship-supporting one — the direction the
// design says to err in". THAT WAS FALSE: it suppressed both, and it was worst
// precisely where a mechanism is HARMFUL, which is the finding a delete-or-keep
// trial most needs. So the NDCG-level bounds are DEMOTED to a reported
// diagnostic that names the harmful mechanism (ctAdditivityDiagnostic), and the
// genuinely arithmetic form of the same relation stays a hard invariant where it
// belongs: on RAW SCORES, in TestCognitionTrial_ArmReconstructionFidelity §6.
//
//	raw-score bounds  = an INVARIANT (non-negative boosts, increasing softplus,
//	                    softplus(bLevelCap)/D == 1) -> a test failure
//	NDCG-level bounds = an OBSERVATION about the mechanisms -> a reported finding
//
// A KILL verdict is a legitimate, valuable outcome. So is UNDERPOWERED. The
// fourth outcome, INCONCLUSIVE-BUT-POWERED, exists precisely so that the
// temptation to round a real-but-small effect up to SHIP has nowhere to go.
//
// WHY THIS FILE IS TAGGED `localassets || cognitiontrial` AND ITS SIBLING
// HARNESS IS NOT. It is a _test.go file, so it is never in a shipped binary
// either way. Under `localassets` alone it compiles and its own table-driven
// tests run in the default CI job, at a cost of milliseconds — because the
// decision procedure and the metrics the verdict rests on must themselves be
// tested, and a rule that only compiles behind a tag CI never passes is a rule
// nobody has checked. Under `localassets cognitiontrial` the operator's harness
// (cognition_trial_measure_test.go) calls exactly these functions, so the thing
// CI tested is the thing that decides.
//
// PRIVACY: this file contains arithmetic and verdict strings. No query text, no
// memory content, no vault name, and no identifier of any kind ever enters it —
// the harness passes in per-query metric VALUES only.

	// D1's exclusion is arm-NEUTRAL in the strong form — the pooled label set is
	// shared, so ctNDCGAt10's `ok` is the same for every arm (verified over

// PROBE-BINDINGNESS INSTRUMENTATION
//
// The anti-inert-gate census (TestCognitionTrialRule_EveryThresholdBinds)
// requires a registered probe for every field of every input struct. It caught
// that a probe can be MISSING. It did not catch that a probe can be EMPTY: an
// `InertNewField` plus a `func(t *testing.T) {}` passed the whole census. So
// presence was enforced and BINDINGNESS was not, which is the same shape as the
// declared-and-never-read field the census exists to find.
//
// ctRuleCalls is incremented by every entry point of the rule. A probe that
// never enters the rule cannot be showing anything about it, and the census now
// fails such a probe by arithmetic rather than by review.
//
// THE LIMIT, stated precisely rather than implied: this makes an EMPTY probe
// decidably inert, and (with ctProbeAssertions) a probe that calls the rule and
// then discards the answer. It does NOT make bindingness decidable in general —
// `ctExpect(t, true, "")` after a ctDecide call still passes, and no in-process
// check can distinguish a vacuous assertion from a real one. The decidable form
// of that is mutation testing (perturb the rule, require the probe to fail),
// which is a separate harness and is NOT built here.
//
// Both counters are atomic because the harness (`cognitiontrial`) also calls
// these functions and this file is compiled into it.

// ctNDCGAt10 computes graded NDCG@10 for one query, and reports whether it is
// DEFINED AT ALL.
//
// ranked is the arm's returned order (memory keys). grades is the POOLED label
// set for this query — the union of every arm's top-10, labeled once, which is
// what makes the labels arm-neutral. The ideal DCG is computed over the pooled
// set, so all five arms are normalized by the same denominator; normalizing
// each arm by its own returned set would let a short list win by returning less.
//
// An unlabeled ranked item contributes gain 0 rather than being skipped:
// skipping it would silently promote whatever came after it, which is the arm
// flattering itself.
//
// # THE SECOND RETURN VALUE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE
//
// When EVERY POOLED GRADE IS 0, IDCG is 0 and NDCG is 0/0 — undefined.
//
// Say that precisely, because the obvious paraphrase is wrong and was in this
// comment: the trigger is NOT "no RELEVANT document". Relevance is the
// binarization grade >= ctRelevantGrade (2), but the NDCG gain vector gives
// grade 1 a gain of 1, so a pool whose every grade is 1 contains no relevant
// document and still has a perfectly well-defined IDCG. Executed: a four-item
// all-grade-1 pool returns (0.7654, true) and is RETAINED and SCORED. The
// undefined set is strictly smaller than the not-relevant set, and D1's
// "zero-relevance" exclusion means ALL GRADES ZERO — not "nothing relevant".
//
// This function used to say "no relevant document" in a comment and
// then `return 0`, which is the SAME DEFECT SHAPE this file family has now hit
// three times: ctMean(nil)==0 padding absent trend buckets as measured zeros
// (fixed by U6), the FTS `idf<=0 -> continue` path (fixed by COG-24's idfMax),
// and this one. A policy comment does not stop the fourth. A TYPE does.
//
// So the undefined case is unrepresentable as a number: ok is false and the
// value is NaN. `ndcg := ctNDCGAt10(...)` no longer compiles, and a caller that
// discards ok with `_` gets a NaN that poisons any mean it enters rather than a
// plausible zero that silently dilutes it. See ctInformative/ctVaultFromSeries
// for what the caller must do with it (D1: EXCLUDE, count, and re-bind the

// Including it as a paired 0-vs-0 difference shrinks the mean by the informative

// WHAT IS AND IS NOT SOUND ABOUT A REDUCED COUNT, corrected. The comment here
// used to end "The interval is not, and no test asserts on an interval from a
// reduced count." THE SECOND HALF WAS FALSE. Both reduced-count callers reach
// ctDecide, and S1, S2, K1, K2, K4 and U5 all read CILower/CIUpper — the
// additivity-convergence test asserts Verdict != UNDERPOWERED on vaults whose
// DeltaC interval came from 100 resamples, and that assertion depends on U5's
// half-width check against a 100-draw interval. It is the third claim of this
// kind on this branch to have been asserted rather than checked.
//
// The correct statement, and it is narrower:
//
//	ctDelta.Point is the EXACT arithmetic mean of the paired differences and is
//	never resampled, so it is bit-identical at any resample count. The INTERVAL
//	is not. A reduced count is therefore sound ONLY at a call site that reads no
//	interval, or one that reads an interval whose insensitivity to the count has
//	been CHECKED at that site — never by blanket assertion here.
//
// Both reduced-count call sites now carry that check AT THE SITE:
//
//   - TestCognitionTrialRule_AdditivityDoesNotConvergeAndIsNotAGate reaches
//     ctDecide and U5 reads its interval, so it re-decides its WIDEST-interval
//     trial at the pre-registered count on every run and requires the same
//     verdict. (Its intervals sit 1.46x inside U5's gate, not the order of
//     magnitude a comment here once guessed — which is why the check is a
//     rebuild and not a margin constant.)
//   - TestCognitionTrialRule_EveryDeltaNMustBindToTheSameSeries' `before` vault

//
//     Delta_HP - Delta_P  == NDCG(NO-PAS)             - NDCG(BASE-LEVEL-ONLY)
//     Delta_HP - Delta_H  == NDCG(NO-HEBBIAN)         - NDCG(BASE-LEVEL-ONLY)
//     Delta_HP - Delta_C  == NDCG(CONTENT-MATCH-ONLY) - NDCG(BASE-LEVEL-ONLY)
//
//     each of which is exactly one mechanism's own contribution measured on top
//     of the base-level prior. A break says that mechanism is NET-HARMFUL on
//     this vault. That is a finding, and it is the single most decision-relevant
//     finding a delete-or-keep trial can produce.
//
// The comment that stood here claimed routing both to UNDERPOWERED "suppresses a
// kill-supporting finding rather than a ship-supporting one — the direction the
// design says to err in". That was FALSE and is removed rather than softened: it
// suppressed BOTH, and it was worst precisely where a mechanism is harmful.
// Executed, one vault set per line:
//
//	base-level HARMFUL, boosts carry a real +0.065 (SHIP was right) -> UNDERPOWERED
//	EVERYTHING harmful — the layer actively hurts (KILL was right)  -> UNDERPOWERED
//	PAS-on-top-of-base HARMFUL, Hebbian carries the win             -> UNDERPOWERED
//
// So: the relations are REPORTED, DECODED and NAMED, and they gate nothing.
//
// NOT DONE, deliberately: an interval-based version (break the relation only
// when the paired CI on the DIFFERENCE of deltas clears zero) would be
// statistically honest and would converge in n. It is not added speculatively —
// it needs its own convergence evidence before it may gate anything, and a

	// Delta_HP = +0.02, this clause's bar, with the (now-deleted) K4 predicate

	// WHY 0.02 AND NOT 0.03: Delta_HP is a MECHANISM quantity — the joint

	// error, deliberately kept. And the worry this veto exists to answer — "a
