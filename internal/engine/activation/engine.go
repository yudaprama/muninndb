			// `final` is query-relative in two ways that make it unusable as a

			//  1. THE ARGMAX EXEMPTION. scale = 1/maxRaw pins the top candidate
			//     to raw exactly 1.0, so its final is exactly its Confidence —
			//     which clears any threshold <= 1.0 unconditionally. Whenever
			//     any candidate saturates (the ACT-R prior reaches 3.24x at full
			//     Hebbian boost, so a memory co-activated moments ago routinely
			//     does), the best candidate of a GARBAGE query is exempt from
			//     abstention and is reported at ~1.0. That is where a query for
			//     a fact that was never stored comes back "confident".
			//  2. THE MIRROR IMAGE. The same rescale divides every OTHER
			//     candidate by maxRaw, so one hot neighbour pushes a genuine
			//     sub-max match below the bar. Same mechanism, opposite failure:
			//     answerable queries returning nothing.
			//
			// And the prior itself has no business in the bar: it spans ~0.03
			// (cold) to 3.24+ (Hebbian-hot), so gating `ContentMatch x prior`
			// holds a recently-touched memory to a relevance bar up to 32x lower
			// than an untouched one. Recency then substitutes for aboutness —
			// and COG-26's b=0.520, which was derived by placing the measured
			// noise ceiling at ContentMatch 0.095 just under a 0.1 gate, stops
			// being the floor production actually enforces.
			//
			// The fix is to gate on the ABSOLUTE evidence instead — ContentMatch,
			// attenuated by the prior only where the prior attenuates (decay must
			// still retire a stale memory), never amplified by it, never rescaled
			// by what else happened to be in this query's pool — times Confidence.
			// Ranking would be untouched: `final` still orders the results, so
			// Hebbian and PAS keep their full power to PROMOTE a relevant memory;
			// they just could not promote an irrelevant one past the bar.
			//
			// MEASURED (abstention_gate_measure_test.go, 18-engram synthetic
			// corpus, real bge-small, 12 answerable paraphrases / 16 nonsense
			// probes, both arms over an identical scored pool):
			//
			//	threshold 0.10   NDCG@5 0.5508 -> 0.6410   FPR 43.8% -> 6.2%
			//	(deterministic since the harness pinned its hot set and age; the
			//	earlier flaky runs understated the old gate's FPR as 12.5-31%)
			//	threshold 0.50   NDCG@5 0.2500 -> 0.0000   FPR  0.0% -> 0.0%
			//
			// At the ENGINE default (0.10, engine.go:2406 — the value COG-26's
			// b=0.520 was calibrated against) the absolute gate wins BOTH metrics
			// outright: better answerable recall AND half the false-positive rate,
			// with average false-positive depth falling 2.5 -> 1.0.
			//
			// At the SURFACE default it collapses to zero recall, and the reason
			// is the finding, not a flaw in the fix: ContentMatch is structurally
			// capped at w_sem (0.6) for a semantic-only match and w_fts (0.4) for
			// a lexical-only one, so NO honest absolute score reaches 0.5 without
			// near-verbatim wording (cos >= 0.9200). Recall at the 0.5 surface
			// default therefore works TODAY ONLY BECAUSE the max-rescale inflates
			// the argmax to 1.0 — the very same line that hands unanswerable
			// queries a confident hit. The confident-garbage and the
			// phrasing-sensitive misses are one mechanism, and 0.5 is survivable
			// only while that mechanism lies.
			//
			// This landed as a coupled change: (1) this gate -> `absolute`, and
			// (2) threshold ownership centralized in the ENGINE's fusion-aware
			// COG-6 coerce (ACT-R 0.1, weighted_sum 0.5, rrf 0.001) with the MCP
			// surface forwarding 0 like every other transport. Shipping (1)
