// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ABSTENTION INVERSION — both directions, one fixture family.
//
// Two independent hands-on evaluations landed on the same complaint: recall
// refuses answerable questions and answers unanswerable ones confidently.
// These tests encode BOTH directions so a fix cannot pass by trading one for
// the other. A change that only tightens the gate breaks the ANSWERABLE
// tests; a change that only loosens it breaks the UNANSWERABLE ones.
//
// Everything here is driven by stubbed cosine / FTS-coverage scores rather
// than a real embedder, on purpose: the diagnosis is arithmetic about a gate,
// and every number below is hand-derived and asserted, so a drift in the
// scoring formula shows up as a specific numeric failure rather than a fuzzy
// "the model moved". Real-embedder end-to-end coverage of the semantic floor
// already exists in semantic_abstention_test.go (localassets-gated); this
// file deliberately costs no assets and no CI minutes.
//
// THE PIPELINE UNDER TEST (activation/engine.go, ACT-R default path):
//
//	semCal       = max(0, (cos-b)/(1-b))                          :2129
//	ContentMatch = 0.6*semCal + 0.4*ftsCoverage                    :2211
//	raw          = ContentMatch * softplus(B+4h+4t)/1.6931         :2273
//	scale        = 1/maxRaw when any candidate's raw exceeds 1.0   :1926
//	final        = min(raw*scale, 1.0) * Confidence                :1930
//	DROP if final < req.Threshold                                  :1934
//
// Threshold ownership is centralized in the ENGINE: the MCP surface forwards
// an omitted threshold as 0 (mcp/handlers.go, like every other transport) and
// the engine's fusion-aware coerce applies ACT-R 0.1 / weighted_sum 0.5 / rrf
// 0.001 (engine.go:2405); activation's own last-resort fallback is 0.05
// (activation/engine.go). All of these gate the SAME quantity, and that
// quantity is not a measure of "is this memory about the query".
//
// PRIVACY: every fixture string is synthetic and authored here.

// near-perfect semantic match — and recall returns NOTHING at the default
// threshold. Rephrasing into the stored wording rescues it.
//

//
//	semCal       = (0.818-0.520)/0.480          = 0.6208

// (base-level is capped) and no candidate's raw exceeds 1.0, so the per-query
// max-rescale is the identity here. The miss happens BEFORE and INDEPENDENT
// of normalisation. Its whole cause is that ContentMatch for a match with
// little lexical overlap is structurally capped near 0.6*semCal, and the
// surface gate is 0.5.
