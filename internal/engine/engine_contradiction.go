// COG-29 — contradiction honesty (#764).
//
// When two results in a recall response are joined by an UNRESOLVED DECLARED
// `contradicts` edge, recall must not present either as the answer. Both are
// returned, demoted, in a defensible order, with a first-class per-row
// annotation, and the response carries a `conflict` block naming the pair and
// the resolution actions.
//
// The phase is DEMOTE-ONLY (it can never lift a row above a genuinely better
// unrelated match), NEVER removes a row, NEVER abstains, and WRITES NOTHING.
//
// Why not top-level abstention, which is what one evaluator literally asked
// for: #747/#754 is the hard-learned lesson in this exact area — suppressing
// BOTH sides of a declared contradiction destroys the true memory exactly as
// hard as the false one, and the agent that did the right thing by declaring
// the conflict loses access to both facts and to the conflict itself.
// Abstention also has a wire contract ("Empty iff Abstained is false",
// mbp/types.go) that two admission-worthy candidates do not satisfy. The
// complaint underneath the ask — "an agent commonly consumes only the first
// result, so this is confidently misleading" — is about presenting one side as
// THE ANSWER, not about returning the data. The demote, the always-on per-row
// annotation and the response-level block remove "the answer" while keeping
// both facts.

// vaultMayHaveContradictions is COG-29's fast-path gate. The phase must be

//
//  1. The in-process per-vault flag. It covers the window between an explicit
//     muninn_link(contradicts) in THIS process and the batch worker writing the
//     0x0A marker (≤ one worker interval after #764 D1), so a single-binary
//     deployment — the default, and the evaluators' case — honors a declaration
//     on the very next query.
//
//  2. A bounded 0x0A seek, answered by one iterator First(). This is the steady
//     state, and it is the only probe that sees an edge declared by ANOTHER
//     process, so it must keep running on every query.
//
//  3. Once per vault per process, a bounded scan for declared-but-unflagged
//     contradicts edges. This exists because probes 1 and 2 TOGETHER have a
//     permanent hole: the in-process flag lives only in memory and the 0x0A
//     marker is written only when the batch worker flushes, so a process that
//     restarts between muninn_link(contradicts) and that flush loses the flag
//     while the marker was never written — and nothing else ever re-probes.
//     Recall would then silently stop honoring a durable, correctly-declared
//     contradiction FOREVER. The scan's result is cached per vault, so a
//     contradiction-free vault pays it exactly once, not once per recall.
//
// Named residual: the once-per-process scan is capped
// (storage.DefaultDeclaredContradictionScanCap). On a vault whose forward
// associations exceed that cap the scan is incomplete, and this gate then
