// READ-ONLY REAL-VAULT DRIVER for the ContentMatch-combiner measurement.
//
// BUILD TAG: `scoringmeasure`. CI builds and tests with `-tags localassets`
// (and `localassets,integration` for the cmd suite) and never with this tag, so
// this file does not compile — let alone run — in any CI job. It is a tool the
// owner runs by hand against a CLONE of a real vault.
//
// THE QUESTION IT SETTLES
//
// MuninnDB's live Phase 6 ContentMatch is LINEAR with hardcoded coefficients:
//
//	ContentMatch = 0.6*semCal + 0.4*ftsCoverage      (activation/engine.go:2211)
//
// That formula charges a MISSING estimator as evidence of irrelevance. A pure
// paraphrase — no lexical overlap with the query, which is the exact case
// retrieval-by-meaning exists to serve — is structurally capped at 0.6, no
// matter how perfect the semantic match. The coefficients are described in the
// source as "proven optimal ... hardcoded proven values" (engine.go:2354-2356)
// but landed inside a large omnibus commit (e51b985) with no recorded
// derivation and no corpus named. Principle #11 forbids exactly that.
//
// This driver is the measurement that must precede any change. Over a set of
// queries and a candidate pool it scores every candidate under four combiners
// and pre-commits to TWO metrics that pull in opposite directions, so no arm
// can win by sacrificing the other:
//
//	NDCG@5 on ANSWERABLE queries    — did the right memory rank high?
//	FPR    on UNANSWERABLE queries  — did the system abstain when it should?
//
// Any combiner more permissive than the live one (noisy-OR and max both are,
// everywhere) necessarily improves the first and worsens the second. A result
// is only interesting if the first improves MORE than the second worsens.
//
// THE ARMS
//
//	LINEAR    ContentMatch = 0.6*semCal + 0.4*fts        — the live formula
//	COSINE    ContentMatch = raw cosine, no prior        — the naive control
//	NOISY-OR  ContentMatch = 1-(1-semCal)(1-fts)         — absence-of-evidence
//	MAX       ContentMatch = max(semCal, fts)            — absence-of-evidence
//
// Each is run TWICE: once with the live Confidence multiplier, and once with
// CONFIDENCE ABLATED TO 1.0. The ablation is mandatory, not optional: a live
// contradiction bug can collapse an engram's Confidence to ~0.07, which alone
// suppresses it by 93% (Confidence multiplies straight into the final score,
// activation/engine.go:2295). Without the ablation the bug could silently
// decide which combiner "wins". If the conf-on and conf-off rankings of the
// arms disagree, the measurement is contaminated and NO conclusion may be drawn
// from the conf-on numbers.
//
// TWO CONDITIONS
//
//	FULL-SIGNAL  candidates carry their real FTS coverage for the query.
//	PARAPHRASE   FTS is forced to 0 for every candidate, simulating a query
//	             with zero lexical overlap. This is the condition the 0.6 cap
//	             is about, and no paraphrase corpus is needed to produce it.
//
// TWO THRESHOLDS — and this one is not cosmetic.
//
//	engine .05   activation/engine.go, the last-resort fallback for a direct
//	             activation caller.
//	shipped .1   the engine's fusion-aware ACT-R default (engine.go:2405) —
//	             what every real agent gets when it omits `threshold`, since
//	             the MCP surface forwards 0 like every other transport. (The
//	             old 0.5 surface default this arm originally measured was
//	             removed with the absolute gate.)
//
// The surface default is the gate that matters, and it exposes the MISSING-
// COSINE case: a memory with no embedding yet scores cosine 0, so ContentMatch
// = 0.4*fts <= 0.4 < 0.5, and is UNRETURNABLE through MCP or REST at defaults
// no matter how perfect the lexical match. That is the same defect as the
// paraphrase cap from the opposite direction — a missing estimator scored as a
// zero rather than as absence of evidence — and it is pinned in
// engine_scoring_weights_model_test.go. Measuring only at 0.05 would report
// numbers no agent ever sees.
//
// THE INDEXING-LAG CONFOUND (third in the list, after confidence collapse and
// the 0.6 cap). A corpus that is still being embedded contaminates everything:
// unembedded engrams are invisible to the full pipeline and unscoreable by the
// raw-cosine control, so the pipeline looks artificially bad and the control
// artificially good. This driver PROVES settlement rather than assuming it —
// it counts active engrams with no stored embedding, reports the fraction, and
// REFUSES TO RUN above 1% (override: MUNINN_SCOREW_MAX_UNEMBEDDED_FRAC).
//
// Exposure, for reference: the retroactive embed processor polls every 3s and
// backs off exponentially to a 3-MINUTE ceiling when idle
// (internal/plugin/retroactive.go:25,36,188-192). Its notifyCh wake path exists
// but NO WRITE PATH CALLS Notify() — the only caller is the processor itself
// when it hits maxBatchSize (retroactive.go:444). So on a vault that has been
// quiet for ~3 minutes, a newly-written memory can wait up to another ~3
// minutes for its embedding, not the ~3s seen on a busy vault.
//
// LABELS ARE MECHANICAL AND ASSIGNED BEFORE SCORING
//
//	answerable   query text = a sampled engram's own summary; the gold
//	             document is that engram, by identity.
//	unanswerable query text = a committed list of SYNTHETIC nonsense strings
//	             authored in this file. Nothing in the vault answers them, so
//	             any returned result above the relevance threshold is a false
//	             positive.
//
// No arm sees the label, the label cannot be influenced by the score, and the
// same labelled query set is scored by every arm — that is the sense in which
// this is blind. It is NOT human relevance judgment, and it does not claim to
// be: "gold = the engram the query text was drawn from" is a proxy that
// rewards finding the source document, which for the FULL-SIGNAL condition is
// an easy target. The PARAPHRASE condition is the discriminating one.
//
// PRIVACY: this driver prints AGGREGATE STATISTICS ONLY. It never prints an
// engram's content, concept, summary, tags, entities, ID, or the vault name,
// and it never writes a file. Every string literal in this file is synthetic.
//
// FIDELITY AND ITS LIMITS — read before believing a number:
//
//   - The pool is the union of the stored-embedding cosine neighborhood and
//     the FTS top-N. It is not the output of engine.Recall: no entity boost,
//     no tag seeding, no associative traversal, no PAS transitions, no
//     currency annotation, no time filters. Every arm sees the same pool, so
//     the COMPARISON is fair; the ABSOLUTE numbers are not "what recall
//     returns".
//   - Unembedded engrams are EXCLUDED from the pool (they cannot be scored by
//     the raw-cosine control at all), and their count is reported. So the
//     driver measures the combiners on a settled corpus; it does NOT measure
//     the missing-cosine case itself — that one is pinned analytically in
//     engine_scoring_weights_model_test.go, where it is exact.
//   - Hebbian and PAS-transition boosts are 0 in every arm. Those are the
//     cognition layer's strongest arguments for itself and they are absent, so
//     the driver's bias runs AGAINST the parts of the layer it cannot see.
//     Say so when quoting a result.
//   - The scorer is a replication (engine_scoring_weights_model_test.go), not
//     the live function. See that file's header for why, and for the pins.
//   - Queries are engram summaries, whose cosine distribution runs higher than
//     real user queries. Read absolute NDCG with that in mind; read the
//     DIFFERENCES between arms as the result.
