	// Four background workers drive the cognitive pipeline:
	//
	//   HebbianWorker          – Hebbian learning: strengthens association
	//                            weights between co-activated engrams.
	//   Worker[ContradictItem] – Contradiction detection: flags engrams
	//                            whose claims conflict with existing knowledge.
	//   Worker[ConfidenceUpdate] – Confidence decay: adjusts confidence
	//                              scores over time based on access patterns.
	//   TransitionWorker       – PAS state transitions: moves engrams
	//                            through lifecycle states (active → stable
	//                            → archived) based on scoring signals.
	//
	// Hot-Swap Design
	//
	// cogMu is an RWMutex that guards all four worker pointers. It exists
	// because worker assignment changes at runtime during cluster role
	// transitions. Three operations interact with it:
	//
	//   cogWorkers()             – acquires RLock, snapshots all four
	//                              pointers, releases lock, returns the
	//                              snapshot. Safe to use after unlock even
	//                              if a concurrent hot-swap occurs.
	//   SetCognitiveWorkers()    – called on Cortex promotion (Raft leader
	//                              election → OnBecameCortex). Acquires
	//                              write lock, sets all workers, releases.
	//   ClearCognitiveWorkers()  – called on Lobe demotion (OnBecameLobe).
	//                              Sets all four pointers to nil under
	//                              write lock. Lobe nodes perform no local
	//                              cognitive processing; effects are
	//                              forwarded to the Cortex.
	//
	// Callback Wiring Invariant
	//
	// HebbianWorker.OnWeightUpdate is always set BEFORE the worker pointer
	// is published. In NewEngine, the callback is wired at construction
	// time. In SetCognitiveWorkers, it is wired before the write lock is
	// released. This guarantees no concurrent goroutine ever reads a
	// HebbianWorker reference that lacks its callback.
	//
	// Lifecycle Ownership
	//
	// The Engine reads worker pointers but does not own their goroutine
	// lifecycle. In cluster mode, ClusterCoordinator creates and stops
	// workers; Engine only exposes them. In standalone mode, server.go
	// creates workers and passes them to NewEngine. transitionWorker is
	// set separately via SetTransitionWorker() because it follows a
	// different wiring sequence during cluster promotion.
	//
	// Shutdown: Engine.Stop() does NOT stop cognitive workers. Cluster
	// code (or server.go in standalone) is responsible for calling
	// hebbianWorker.Stop(), etc. before the process exits.

// scores on a tag it no longer has and cannot score on the tag it just gained
// (#720, TestUpdateTags_ReindexesFTS).
//
// The reindex goes through fts.ReindexEngram, SYNCHRONOUSLY, and that is
// deliberate on both counts.
//
// One call, because delete-then-add is not statistics-neutral: fts.IndexEngram
// increments the per-term document frequency df_t for every term of the document
// (and bumps TotalEngrams) while fts.DeleteEngram decrements neither, so pairing
// them made every retag decay the engram's own score for a query on its own
// unchanged content — measured at 82.6% over 100 retags against a 10.0% drop for
// an unretagged control in the same vault. ReindexEngram moves df_t only for
// terms whose membership actually changed and never touches the global stats;
// see its doc comment for the arithmetic.
//
// Synchronously, because this is the one FTS path that DELETES before it adds.
// Every other ftsWorker.Submit site only ever adds postings, so a job dropped
// under queue pressure costs visibility of new content. Here a dropped job — a
// full queue, a worker stopped mid-shutdown, a crash in the ~100ms window —
// would leave the engram with NO postings at all, invisible to keyword search
// under its concept and content, not just its tags, until someone ran
// reindex-fts. That is strictly worse than the stale-tag bug the reindex
// replaces. The delete half was already synchronous and a retag is rare, so
// there is nothing to buy by keeping half of it on the worker.
//
// TRASH is de-indexed; HISTORY is reindexed. The drop is gated on
// activation.CarriesSupersessionSignature, not on State alone. Only a plain
// soft-delete — muninn_forget without not_true_since, which leaves ValidUntil
// OPEN — gets its postings dropped: that record is trash, Forget already
// de-indexed it at delete time, and re-adding it would put a discarded document
// back where it burns candidate seed slots.
//
// Everything else is reindexed, including a CLOSED-stamp soft-delete and an
// archived record. An earlier revision dropped postings for StateSoftDeleted/
// StateArchived unconditionally, reasoning that phase 6 filters both before
// returning candidates. That premise is false in exactly the case that matters:
// activation.PassesLifecycle ADMITS a soft-deleted engram carrying a closed
// ValidUntil under as_of or include_invalid — precisely the evolve/supersedes
// signature — and Evolve deliberately does NOT delete its predecessor's postings
// the way Forget does, because those postings are what a query phrased in the
// OLD wording still matches (COG-28 then resolves that evidence forward to the
// chain head). So retagging an evolve predecessor permanently destroyed the
// keyword path to a superseded fact that as_of is contracted to still reach,

//     `superseded_by` = the merged id instead of a bare soft-delete.
//   - Their FTS postings are KEPT, exactly as evolve keeps a predecessor's.
//     That is what lets the old wording reach the source and be redirected to
//     the merged memory; deleting them (what the old `Forget` path did) is
//     precisely what made the hole unreachable from the lexical side.

// the weight-1.0 index entry that is the repair's only disambiguator. A pass
