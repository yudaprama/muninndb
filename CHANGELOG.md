## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-04

The hardening release. Three days after 0.10.0, fifty merges: a systematic
audit of the association read/write layer, the cluster subsystem taken from
"replicates" to "converges", a cross-tenant isolation fix, and the read path
made provably write-free. Nearly every fix below landed with a test proven
to fail without it.

**Upgrade notes.** Migrations **v5** (replication keyspace relocation) and
**v6** (vault-scoped entity records) run automatically on first start; a
pre-migration binary refuses to start against a migrated data directory, so
keep the `muninn.<version>.bak` this release's upgrade command now leaves
beside the binary if you may need to roll back. Expect entity
`mention_count` values to go DOWN — v6 recomputes them from each vault's own
links, replacing an upsert counter that re-enrichment and replay had been
inflating. Cluster operators: v5 drops historical replication log entries
(Lobes re-sync via snapshot), and a write sent to a Lobe is now refused with
a pointer to the Cortex instead of accepted and silently lost — repoint any
load balancer that lacks leader affinity. Single-node deployments only need
the rollback note.

### Added

- **UPSERT write mode, keyed to a caller identity** (#556). A caller-supplied
  `op_id` pins to a head engram via a new 0x30 prefix: a key miss creates,
  identical content is a strict no-op, and changed content evolves — declaring
  supersession per COG-28 — re-pointing the identity atomically inside the
  evolve batch. Identity is the key, never the content, so identity-addressed
  creates neither consult nor populate the content-hash dedup index (distinct
  keys with identical text must not collapse onto one engram and share fate).
  An Active-but-expired head (COG-19 `not_true_since`) takes the create branch
  rather than stranding the key. Append-mode credentials may create and no-op
  but are refused the content-change branch (SEC-15). A gRPC response hint is
  deferred (needs a proto regen).
- **Recall-health and MCP auth-source metrics** (#606, #648). Three Prometheus
  counters close two log-only blind spots:
  `muninndb_recall_embed_fallback_total{vault}` and
  `muninndb_recall_errors_total{vault,reason}` make the embed→BM25 fallback
  observable beyond the per-call `SemanticDegraded` field, and
  `muninn_mcp_auth_total{source}` surfaces the credential mix
  (api_key/capability/static_token/open) at a single instrumentation point —
  never the credential or any prefix of it; denied requests are not counted.
- **A reproducible anisotropy corpus and baseline measurement** (#719): the
  canonical 160-sentence, 20-domain corpus behind the semantic-abstention
  floor's `AnisotropyBaseline` statistic, plus
  `docs/internals/anisotropy-calibration.md`. Deliberately adds no
  noise-baseline registry entry: which measurement protocol the registry
  adopts is an open maintainer decision, and μ/σ are framed as model
  properties with `k` a policy choice behind the existing per-vault
  `SemanticFloor` override.
- **`muninn_update_tags` MCP tool.** Replaces an engram's tag set in place —
  the ULID, version lineage, and access history are all preserved (unlike
  `muninn_evolve`, which mints a new ULID and archives the predecessor).
  Takes `vault`, `id`, and `tags`; an empty `tags` array clears all tags.
  The tag set is normalized exactly as `muninn_remember` normalizes it —
  non-string and over-128-**byte** entries are **dropped, not rejected**, and
  the set is **truncated to 50** — so diff the `tags` the response echoes back
  against what you sent. (The limit is bytes, not glyphs: a 50-glyph CJK tag is
  150 bytes and is dropped.) A soft-deleted memory can still be retagged, but its
  keyword-search postings stay dropped while it is deleted — that is what keeps a
  deleted memory out of search results — so retag it again after
  `muninn_restore` if it must be findable by the new tags. Brings the MCP tool
  count to 45. (#720)
- **`--log-file`/`MUNINN_LOG_FILE` and a `SIGHUP` log-reopen signal, so log rotation is possible under a process supervisor** (#850). Previously the daemon handled only `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`; there was no way to tell it to reopen its log destination, so the standard rotation contract (a rotator renames the file, then signals the writer to reopen it) had nothing to signal — `logrotate` without `copytruncate` and BSD `newsyslog` (which has no copy-truncate equivalent at all) were both unworkable, and copy-truncate itself has a lossy window. When `--log-file`/`MUNINN_LOG_FILE` names a path, the daemon opens its own descriptor on it (independent of inherited stderr) and `SIGHUP` closes and reopens it under a lock, so no log line is dropped or split across the swap. Without an explicit log file, `SIGHUP` is a documented no-op (a WARN is logged) rather than guessing at a destination — there is no portable way to resolve "whatever stderr currently is" back to a path. `muninn start` sets `MUNINN_LOG_FILE` automatically to its historical `muninn.log` path, so the common case gets rotation support with no configuration change. SIGHUP was chosen over SIGUSR1: it's the long-standing reopen/reload convention (syslog, nginx, Apache) and nothing in this codebase used it; it also compiles on the Windows build of `syscall` (unraisable there, so the reopen path is simply unreachable) where `syscall.SIGUSR1` does not exist at all. **This log-rotation mechanism is POSIX-only** — Windows has no process-signal equivalent to deliver `SIGHUP` with, so there is no trigger for reopen on that platform at all; see `docs/self-hosting.md`.
- **`MUNINN_ACCESS_LOG` decouples the REST per-request access log from `--log-level`** (#851). The access log line was `slog.Info`, so silencing it meant raising the global level to `warn` — which also discarded every other INFO event (startup, migrations, enrichment, decay, pruner activity). `MUNINN_ACCESS_LOG=0` now silences only the per-request line; every other INFO log is unaffected. On by default, matching existing `MUNINN_LOCAL_EMBED`-style opt-out-with-`"0"` knobs.

### Fixed

- **A `read_only:true` `Activate` no longer restores an archived association edge, and no
  longer freshens the L1 read cache's recency timestamp for candidates it merely scores**
  (#846). Two independent gaps, both project-wide (any caller of `Activate` with
  `read_only:true`, not a single surface):
  - Phase 4.75's lazy archive restore had no `ReadOnly` gate at all — every read-only
    `Activate` whose candidates touched an archived (0x25) association edge could mint a
    live 0x03/0x04/0x14 row for it via `RestoreArchivedEdgesTransitive`, including that
    call's stranded-row DELETE branch, contradicting COG-11's "a read must not mutate
    learning state" text. Fixed by gating the phase 4.75 call on the resolved
    `actReq.ReadOnly`; the restore still happens, lazily, on the next non-read-only
    `Activate` that reaches the edge.
  - A read-only `Activate`'s engram load stamped the L1 cache's recency timestamp for
    every candidate it scored, not just ones it returned, and that timestamp feeds real
    ACT-R recency scoring in a later, unrelated recall — a scoring pass is not a user
    access. Fixed with `storage.ContextWithNoAccessCacheStamp`, threaded from
    `activation.phase6Score` whenever `req.ReadOnly` is true: the entry is still cached
    (a same-call re-read avoids a Pebble round-trip) but its recency timestamp is left
    unstamped until a real, non-read-only access touches it.

  See `docs/internals/invariants.md` COG-11's amendments for the mechanism and pinning
  tests.
- **`muninn shell`'s `use <vault>` no longer reports success when the vault switch was not
  persisted, and no longer clobbers unrelated keys in `~/.muninn/config`** (#634). The shell's
  `use` command did call the persistence function (the issue's stated "does not persist"
  mechanism did not reproduce), but that function, `saveDefaultVault`, discarded every error
  from `MkdirAll`, `json.Marshal`, and `WriteFile` and always printed `Switched to vault
  '<name>'` regardless of whether the write actually happened — a non-writable config path, a
  full disk, or a permissions problem produced exactly the reported symptom of a stale default
  vault surviving a switch the user was told succeeded. It also marshalled a fresh
  `map[string]string{"default_vault": vault}` on every call, discarding any other key already
  in the file. `saveDefaultVault` now returns an error, read-modify-writes to preserve unknown
  keys, and `use` reports the failure and falls back to a session-only switch instead of
  printing an unqualified success message.

- **Consolidation now DECLARES supersession, closing a permanent recall hole over the fact it was meant to preserve** (#779).
  `muninn_consolidate` / `POST /api/consolidate` archived its source memories with a plain
  soft-delete: no `supersedes` edge, an open validity window. That is exactly the signature the
  version-head mechanism reads as "trash, not history", so consolidation was the one
  content-replacing operation excluded from the mechanism built to close this hole — a later
  query phrased against a source's wording reached a record recall discards, with nothing
  declaring where the content went, and came back with nothing about the merged fact. Evolve
  declares supersession; `muninn_link(relation="supersedes")` declares it; consolidate did not.
  Each source now gets a `supersedes` edge from the merged memory plus a closed validity window,
  in one atomic write per source — the same shape `muninn_evolve` writes.

  **Contract change, user-visible.** Consolidated sources are now time-travellable LINEAGE
  rather than plain archived records:

  - A recall phrased against a source's wording returns the MERGED memory, annotated with
    `substituted_for` and `substitution_basis`, instead of returning nothing.
  - `as_of` (before the merge) and `include_invalid` now return the sources; previously a
    consolidated source was invisible to both. `muninn_read` on a source reports
    `superseded_by` = the merged id.
  - The sources' full-text postings are KEPT (deleting them is what made the merged content
    unreachable from the lexical side). They are still excluded from ordinary present-day
    recall, exactly as before.
  - The response field is still named `archived`, for compatibility.

  **Consolidations that already ran are not migrated and need no repair pass.** Their sources
  carry the plain-forget signature, which every read path already interprets correctly — their
  behaviour is unchanged rather than half-converted. Note that the embed-lag race the issue
  describes was not the cause and was already closed: `Consolidate` writes through the normal
  write path, which wakes the retroactive embed processor (#767).

  Note also what did NOT change: the merged memory still starts with no access history or
  association edges of its own, so it can rank below its sources' former standing. Inheriting
  that standing is deferred — it needs a design pass, not a one-line fix.

- **`muninn_evolve` now warns when it carries the predecessor's concept onto changed content** (#769).
  `concept` has always been a declared parameter of `muninn_evolve`, read by the handler and
  honored by the engine — that half of the report did not reproduce. What was missing was the
  loudness: a caller who replaced the substance and left `concept` unset got a successor whose
  label describes the OLD fact, silently, and every concept-surfacing view
  (`muninn_where_left_off`, session summaries, the console list) then presents that stale claim
  as current. The response now carries a warning naming the carried label and the parameter to
  set. It fires whenever the label was inherited — deciding whether an old label still fits new
  content needs a reader, and this runtime deliberately has none, so it announces rather than
  guesses. An explicit `concept` produces no warning.

- **`muninn_entity` no longer reports co-occurrences and relationships whose every supporting memory was superseded** (#780).
  Both views read capture-time ledgers that only a HARD delete corrects, so an entity retired by
  an evolve that replaced the entity list — the "we moved off that technology" act — kept
  appearing under `co_occurs_with` forever, while the same response's `engrams` list already
  excluded every record behind it. Presence is now decided at read time against live support:
  an edge is reported only while some live memory still co-mentions the pair. Two clarifications
  against the report: the counter IS decremented on hard delete (just never on supersession),
  and an ordinary evolve carries entities onto the live successor, so those pairs are genuinely
  live and are still reported. The count itself is unchanged — it is a historical strength
  signal and is honest as one. On an entity with more than 500 live memories the check is
  abandoned rather than applied to a partial view (filtering on a partial view would delete real
  edges) and a warning is logged.

- **`muninn logs` no longer reads `<dataDir>/muninn.log` unconditionally** (#852). That file is written only by the CLI's own fork-a-daemon path; a daemon started under a process supervisor (a systemd unit execing `--daemon` directly, launchd with `StandardErrorPath`, `docker run`) never writes it, so `muninn logs` silently tailed a frozen file from whenever the daemon was last started by hand — with no error and no staleness indicator, showing a previous daemon lifetime's log (including its `shutdown complete` line) as if it were current. The daemon now records its actual log destination in a `muninn.logdest` sidecar at every startup, independent of how it was started; `muninn logs` reads that instead of guessing, and prints guidance (pointing at `journalctl` for a known systemd unit, or general supervisor guidance otherwise) rather than presenting stale or wrong content as current. A pre-fix daemon, or a data directory nothing has ever run in, falls back to the historical default path unchanged.
- **`relationships[]` naming a hard-deleted engram now fails the write, matching `associations[]`** (#817).
  `mbp.WriteRequest` has two inline edge fields. `associations[]` has refused a
  target with no live engram record since #803 (`ErrDanglingEndpoint`, mapped
  to `ErrInvalidID` — REST/gRPC/MBP answer 400). `relationships[]` reached the
  same store-level guard through a different route — a post-write loop calling
  `store.WriteAssociation` — which correctly refused the edge but only logged
  a WARN and returned 200 regardless, so the relationship silently did not
  exist. This was the more commonly hit half of the asymmetry: `muninn_link`
  and `muninn_remember` — the MCP surface, the most common agent path — use
  `relationships`, not `associations`.

  **Client-visible change.** A `relationships[]` entry (on `Engine.Write` or
  `Engine.WriteBatch`) naming a target with no live 0x01 engram record now
  fails the write with the same `ErrInvalidID` → 400 that a dangling
  `associations[]` entry has produced since #803, instead of returning
  200/201 with the edge silently dropped. A malformed (unparseable)
  `target_id` in `relationships[]`, previously also silently skipped with a
  WARN, is refused the same way for the same reason. `Engine.WriteBatch`
  fails only the item carrying the bad relationship; sibling items are
  unaffected.

  Chosen over annotating the response with a per-item warning (the
  alternative the issue named as closer to this project's "degrade loudly"
  line) because it reuses the existing, already-tested atomic guard
  (`checkInlineAssocTargets`, run before the engram itself is persisted)
  rather than adding a new response-shape across MBP/REST/gRPC/MCP — the
  in-tree mechanism `associations[]` already has, extended rather than a
  second one invented next to it (STO-12).

- **Writes to a non-Cortex node are no longer accepted and lost** (#596, #631).
  A `muninn_remember` delivered to a Lobe — by a load balancer without leader
  affinity, a stale DNS record, or a VIP that failed over to a replica —
  returned success with an engram id, committed the memory to that one node's
  Pebble, and never forwarded it. Nothing in the write path knew the node's
  role: `IsLeader()` had no caller outside `internal/replication` and the REST
  status handlers. The engram was invisible cluster-wide and destroyed by the
  next resnapshot. Vault configuration (including per-vault plasticity), API
  keys and capability tokens had the same shape *and* a second one: they wrote
  straight to Pebble, bypassing the replication log entirely, so a key minted or
  a preset set on the Cortex reached a Lobe only via a full join snapshot —
  never incrementally — and a failover served the pre-failover defaults.

  Both are closed. In cluster mode a client write is accepted only on the
  Cortex, and configuration now travels the same replication path as engrams.

  **Client-visible change — this is a breaking behaviour change for anyone
  sending writes to a replica.** A write that previously returned 201/200 on a
  Lobe now fails, naming the Cortex to retry against:

  | Surface | Before | Now |
  |---|---|---|
  | REST | `201`/`200` | **`421 Misdirected Request`**, error code `4015`, headers `X-Muninn-Cortex-Id` and `X-Muninn-Cortex-Addr` |
  | MCP | tool result | JSON-RPC error **`-32002`**, message names the Cortex |
  | gRPC | `OK` | **`FAILED_PRECONDITION`** |
  | MBP | `WriteOK` | error frame, code **`4015`** |

  Reads are untouched on every surface — serving reads is what a Lobe is for —
  and so is the cluster-administration API, so an operator can still promote or
  fail over *from* a Lobe. A standalone (non-cluster) server installs no gate
  and is completely unaffected.

  Rejecting rather than transparently forwarding is deliberate: there is no
  node-to-node write RPC to forward over, forwarding would have correct
  followers pump traffic into the wrong side of a split brain, and rejection
  introduces no new timeout. The full argument is recorded at
  `mbp.NotLeaderError` and in invariant SEC-13.

- **A Lobe can no longer be talked backwards into a stale cluster, silently**
  (#631). After a Cortex was rebuilt from an empty data directory, a Lobe still
  holding the old, higher epoch and a far-ahead apply cursor rejoined
  successfully, reported `lag: 0`, and received nothing — forever. The apply
  cursor is an in-memory field on the applier with no reset path, and
  `WipeForResnapshot` deliberately preserves the epoch, so after the snapshot
  landed the node skipped every entry the new Cortex shipped (they were all
  below its cursor) while the lag calculation clamped to 0. The join path now
  rebases the apply cursor onto the snapshot's baseline and adopts the Cortex's
  epoch with it; a backwards epoch offered **without** a resnapshot is refused
  outright with an error naming both epochs and the remedy, because nothing
  would reconcile the divergence. `EpochStore.ForceSet` is gone: `Advance` is
  monotonic and *reports* whether it moved, so a caller can no longer swallow a
  regression by ignoring a nil error, and the single legitimate backwards path
  is the explicitly named `AdoptForSnapshot`.
- **Cluster catch-up no longer spirals: a slow replica is not a dead one**
  (#627). Every frame write was bounded by one fixed 5-second deadline — a
  constant applied to a quantity measured somewhere else entirely, since the
  frame may be a 40-byte heartbeat or a 1 MB snapshot chunk and the link may be
  loopback or a laptop on a WAN tunnel. A replica that fell behind could not get
  back: the receiver applied entries more slowly than the sender pushed, the
  socket buffer filled, one write crossed 5 seconds, the stream died, the
  replica rejoined further behind. Raising the constant only moves the cliff, so
  the bound was replaced rather than retuned. A frame write now fails only when
  the peer accepts **no bytes at all** for the idle timeout; the deadline resets
  on every byte of forward progress, which makes it independent of frame size
  and link speed. Two outer bounds keep that from becoming unbounded: a single
  frame may not hold a connection's write slot beyond `sendMaxDuration`
  (2 minutes) even while dribbling, and a caller that cannot get the write slot
  within `sendSlotWait` gets `ErrPeerBusy` — the peer is busy, not dead, the
  connection is left intact, and the shared heartbeat broadcast moves on instead
  of blocking behind a multi-megabyte transfer.

  A restarted replication stream also no longer restarts from sequence 0. It
  resumes from the highest position the primary can prove the replica holds:
  its last acknowledged sequence, or the snapshot sequence quoted in its join
  response, whichever is higher. (The snapshot source is not redundant — the
  snapshot receiver does not advance the replica's applier position, so a
  freshly-snapshotted replica acknowledges a low sequence while holding a
  complete database.) Previously the re-transfer volume tracked the size of the
  log rather than the size of the lag. A stream that ends now logs where it
  started, how far it got, and where the log is, so a stalled replica is visible
  instead of indistinguishable from an idle one.

- **Enabling clustering at runtime built a coordinator that could not
  replicate** (#628). `POST /api/admin/cluster/enable` constructed and started a
  cluster coordinator inside the running process. That coordinator could never
  work: the storage layer's replication hook is captured when the Pebble store
  is built at boot, and only when `cluster.yaml` already said enabled at that
  moment. A node enabled this way reported itself clustered, accepted replicas
  and shipped them a snapshot — and then appended **nothing** it wrote to the
  replication log. It also never received the WAL handle, so it never pruned
  (unbounded log growth), and it registered joiners as voters against a quorum
  the boot path would have computed differently.

  There is now no code path that constructs a coordinator outside boot. The
  endpoint persists the configuration and answers **`202 Accepted`** with
  `restart_required: true`, `enabled: false`, and a message saying so; the web
  console shows a restart-required banner instead of "Cluster active". This is a
  **behaviour change** for anyone scripting that endpoint: a successful call is
  now 202, not 200, and clustering starts on the next restart of the node.
- **Pebble prefix `0x19` was allocated twice, and a cluster prune would have
  deleted idempotency receipts** (#726). `internal/replication` inlined a raw
  `0x19` for every key it wrote, so a replication log entry (`0x19|seq_be64(8)`)
  and an idempotency receipt (`0x19|siphash(op_id)(8)`) had the same prefix, the
  same length, and the same database, with no discriminator between them —
  116,248 entries alongside 23 receipts on one production store.
  `ReplicationLog.Prune` range-deletes `[0x19|be64(1), 0x19|be64(untilSeq+1))`,
  which is precisely "every receipt whose SipHash is below the watermark": a
  vanishing probability at today's sequence numbers, growing linearly with the
  sequence, and armed the moment the prune gets a production caller. The
  sequence counter was worse-placed still, at `0x19|0xFF*8` — *inside* the entry
  range. The whole replication keyspace now lives at `0x2F` with a
  sub-namespace byte, so the prune's range provably contains nothing but log
  entries. **Migration v5** relocates existing stores; it drops the old log
  entries (key by key, behind a positive identification — never a range delete,
  since receipts share that range) and compacts, which is also where a bloated
  store gets its disk back. A pre-v5 binary refuses to start against a migrated
  data directory. See `docs/cluster-operations.md` for the upgrade note.

- **Observers accumulated the Cortex's replication log forever** (#826). Two
  mechanisms, both closed. The snapshot sender iterated the entire database, so
  every joining Lobe received a byte-for-byte copy of the Cortex's log — entries
  that each carry the full key and value of a replicated write — which nothing
  on a Lobe ever reads and nothing there prunes (the periodic prune is
  leader-gated). And `RepLogAppend` was wired unconditionally on every cluster
  node, so a Lobe logged a full-size entry for each of its *own* local writes
  (last-access touches, Hebbian updates, decay), which is why a measured lobe
  held more entries than the Cortex it followed: 22 GB and 7.5 GB on two
  observers. Snapshots now skip the log entries and only the log entries — the
  replication metadata, above all the sequence counter, still ships, so a
  promoted Lobe continues the cluster's numbering — and a node that is
  definitively a follower no longer appends. The suppression fails **open** on
  an unknown role, so a leader serving writes during startup can never silently
  drop them out of the stream. Neither filter was expressible before #726: under
  `0x19` both would have discarded idempotency receipts too.
- **`hebbian_enabled` now governs the read side too** (COG-32). The phase-4
  Hebbian boost ran unconditionally during recall while its neighbour, the PAS
  transition boost, was gated — so a vault with `hebbian_enabled: false` (the
  `scratchpad` preset) was still scored by association edges it would never
  update and never decay. The flag is now symmetric: it gates learning, decay
  and the read-side boost. **User-visible:** `scratchpad` vaults score recall
  without any Hebbian contribution, and rows can reorder on such vaults.
- **An explicit `actr_heb_scale: 0` is honored** instead of being silently
  replaced by the 4.0 default. Two layers substituted it; the config layer had
  always admitted it. `actr_heb_scale` scales both the Hebbian and the PAS
  transition boost, so 0 is the "no cognitive prior at all" switch — it now
  works.
- **Co-activation writes carry their own timestamp.** `CoActivationEvent.At`
  was set by the engine and then dropped, so an association's `lastActivated`
  was stamped at write time rather than at co-activation time. An event that
  waited in the worker's channel was stamped late. Zero-value behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **An association's decay anchor never moves backwards** (COG-27). Making the
  co-activation timestamp writable also made it *remotely* writable: in a
  cluster, a cog-forwarded co-activation carries the peer's clock verbatim.
  `lastActivated` is COG-27's elapsed-time input, so a stale stamp collapsed a
  live edge's decay ceiling on the next pass — irreversibly, since decay never
  raises a weight. Both association writers now keep the later of the stored and
  the incoming stamp, the same shape `peakWeight` already had beside them.
  **User-visible in cluster mode only:** a lagging or skewed peer, or a
  cog-forward backlog delivered after a partition heals, can no longer age
  another node's associations by the size of the clock gap.
- `RecallEvent`'s doc comment no longer claims a "positives = surfaced AND
  cited" ground-truth join that is not implementable from what is on disk (no
  join key, no identity on either side, context-free residue, and a citation
  side damaged by the #757 class).
- **An association edge can no longer outlive its endpoints** (#803). Hard
  deletes left the dead engram in the FTS and vector indexes, so the automatic
  association workers kept finding it and minting fresh edges to an ID that no
  longer existed — growing with use, and never reaped, because association decay
  does not read engram records. Both hard-delete callers now clean both search
  indexes, `DeleteEngram` cascades archived (0x25) edges in both directions, and
  every association writer refuses an edge whose endpoint has no engram record.
  The delete cascade also missed every edge at weight ≤ ~1/256 (and at the
  legacy full-weight key position) because of a scan-bound bug; those edges were
  unreapable, and the startup key-repair pass could promote one into a live
  dangling edge. Both are closed.

  **Client-visible change:** a write whose `associations[].target_id` names a
  memory that has been hard-deleted is now **rejected** instead of silently
  accepted. The row it used to create pointed at nothing. How the rejection
  surfaces is per-transport: REST's single-write path returns **400**; REST's
  batch endpoint still returns 201 with `status: "error"` on that item only, its
  siblings committing as before; gRPC and MBP return their existing error for an
  invalid ID. `relationships[]` is unchanged in this
  release — it still logs a warning and succeeds (#817).

- **A retag no longer leaves stale full-text-search postings.** Tags are
  tokenized into the BM25 posting lists, but the storage-level tag update only
  rewrote the record and the tag indices, so after changing a tag recall scored
  the memory on a tag it no longer had and could not score it on the tag it had
  just gained. `Engine.UpdateTags` now rebuilds the engram's postings in one
  atomic operation, keyed on the document captured before the write. (The tag
  *indices* were never affected — the recall pipeline re-checks them against the
  engram's real tags — but the full-text score feeds ranking directly with
  nothing to re-verify it.) This also stops a retagged-then-forgotten memory from
  staying keyword-searchable under a tag it used to have. (#720)

- **Curating a memory's tags no longer makes it harder to find.** The obvious way
  to rebuild an engram's postings — delete them, then index the new document —
  is not statistics-neutral: indexing increments the per-term document frequency
  for *every* term the memory contains (and the corpus size), while deleting
  decrements neither. Because BM25's inverse document frequency is
  `ln((N+1)/(df+0.5))`, each edit moved the denominator by a whole document and
  the numerator barely at all, so a memory's score for a query on its own
  **unchanged** content decayed on every retag: measured on a 60-memory vault,
  −8.1% from a single retag, below a 0.3 recall threshold by ten, and −82.6%
  after a hundred against a −10.0% drop for an untouched control in the same
  vault. Since `muninn_update_tags` exists precisely for `due:<ISO-date>`-style
  conventions, ten retags is under two weeks of ordinary use, and nothing
  surfaced the loss. Retagging is now stats-neutral by construction: one
  full-text-index operation that leaves the corpus size alone and moves a term's
  document frequency only when the term genuinely entered or left the memory.
  Scoped honestly: that neutrality is with respect to how many times you retag,
  not to how big the tag set is. A memory whose tag set grows in place is still
  length-normalized by BM25 like any longer document, and because the rebuild
  leaves the corpus *average* document length alone, that penalty is slightly
  over-applied until the next `muninn reindex-fts` — the conservative direction,
  scores under-credited rather than inflated. There is no ratchet either way:
  returning to a previous tag set restores the previous score exactly. (#720)

- **A retag no longer makes a deleted memory keyword-searchable again.** A retag
  rebuilt the posting lists with no state check, undoing the soft delete's own
  full-text cleanup. Recall never returned the memory (the pipeline filters
  deleted and archived memories out before scoring), but the postings still
  consumed candidate slots. A soft-deleted or archived memory now gets its
  postings dropped and nothing written back — it stays retaggable, and the
  record is updated as before. (#720)

- **A rejected retag no longer leaves the wrong tags visible.** `muninn_read`
  could echo tags that had been rejected and never stored, and — worse — a recall
  filtered on the memory's *real* tags could drop it, because the same in-memory
  copy backs both. The storage-level tag update mutated the cached record before
  validating it and then returned from the validation-failure path without
  dropping the cache entry, so a call that reported an error still changed what
  every reader saw until the entry was evicted. Reachable from MCP with a tag
  whose `key:value` value contains a NUL byte. The cache entry is now dropped on
  every exit path, and the committed record is re-cached after the write — which
  also closes the window where a concurrent reader could re-cache the
  pre-commit tags on top of a committed update. (#720)

- **A concurrent retag can no longer resurrect a deleted memory.** The
  storage-level tag update re-encodes the whole record, so unlocked it wrote back
  every field from a snapshot that could predate a committed delete — leaving the
  memory `active` in the record while the state index said `soft_deleted`
  (`muninn_forget` succeeds, `muninn_list_deleted` shows it as deleted, and
  recall keeps returning it), and reverting a concurrent access-count
  reinforcement. It now holds the same per-engram stripe lock every sibling
  read-modify-write holds ([STO-2]/[STO-3]). (#720)

- **`GET /api/admin/embed/status` now honors an optional `?vault=` query
  parameter** (#802). It previously accepted the parameter and silently
  ignored it — every vault on a multi-vault instance got the same
  instance-wide `embedded_count`/`total_count`, which reads as a per-vault
  coverage ratio and is not one. `total_count` now comes from `Stat` scoped to
  the same vault (already supported); `embedded_count` gained a new
  vault-scoped storage path (`CountEmbeddedInVault`), since the 0x11
  DigestFlags keyspace it reads from is deliberately global and cannot be
  scanned by vault directly — it scans the vault's own engram IDs and looks
  up each one's flags instead. Both counts always share scope by
  construction, so the ratio stays honest. `rate_per_sec`/`eta_seconds`
  remain instance-wide — a named, documented deferral, not silently wrong.
  Omitted or empty `vault` preserves the historical instance-wide behavior.

- **Cache-returned engrams are read-only; writers clone** (#858). Seven write
  paths — evolve's `mutateEngram`, `SoftDelete`, `UpdateTagsLocked`,
  `UpdateConfidence`, `UpdateConfidenceWithContradiction`, `UpdateDigest` and
  one more, found by an AST census rather than a method-name sweep — mutated
  the shared L1-cache struct in place, racing every concurrent reader.
  The per-engram stripe locks four of them relied on never helped: readers
  never take them, and `GetEngram` re-caches what it decodes, so the pointer
  is shared again before the caller sees it. Reproduced under `-race` with
  nothing but a `GetEngram` loop as the second party. Writers now clone
  before mutating; the read-only contract is pinned as STO-20.
- **A symmetric association is now readable from both endpoints during
  ranking** (#800). Association writers disagreed on edge direction (the
  Hebbian worker canonicalises older→newer; the neighbour and autoassoc
  workers write newer→older) and the ranking phases read only the forward
  index, so the SAME relationship boosted a candidate at full strength from
  one endpoint and by exactly zero from the other — measured end to end: one
  link scored `hebbian_boost` 0.4 from its source and 0 from its target,
  moving that row's recall score from 0.7150 to 0.3862. Ranking now reads a
  relation-type-filtered union of both directions in a new sibling method;
  `GetAssociations` is deliberately unchanged and pinned forward-only — its
  consumers include a writer (dream persists what it infers) and
  direction-presenting surfaces (COG-31).
- **A failed association read is no longer written back as fabricated
  defaults** (#809). "No such edge" and "the read failed" collapsed into one
  zero-valued return, which the weight-update paths re-encoded over the live
  edge: a transient Pebble read fault reset an edge's `relType`
  (reclassifying directional edges — supersession, parent/child — as Hebbian
  co-activation), its `createdAt`, and its `peakWeight`, the anchor of the
  decay ceiling. Read errors now propagate and the write is refused; the
  Hebbian worker no longer treats a failed read as cold start and re-seeds a
  strong edge, and dream no longer infers a fresh edge over an existing one
  it failed to read.
- **Four association-layer defects: two laundered reads, three unevicted
  caches, one aliased slice** (#804, #808, #818, #820). The worst:
  `FlagContradiction` treated a FAILED idempotency-marker read as "newly
  flagged" and restamped `detectedAt`, re-firing the non-invertible
  confidence penalty — compounding 1.0 → 0.0709 on BOTH engrams, the true one
  included, from one corrupt block that was otherwise harmless. Marker reads
  now distinguish absent / corrupt / failed, and the two callers take
  deliberately opposite actions because their loss directions are opposite:
  flagging fails closed (one deferred penalty), the confidence update fails
  open on the marker only (the stamp on disk is never replaced). Also: a scan
  that died partway is no longer served — or cached for the TTL — as a
  short-but-complete edge list (which `currencyInDeclaredChain` read as "not
  in a chain", minting false advisories); the three edge-mutating sites that
  bypassed the association caches now evict them; and the cache-MISS path no
  longer hands the first caller a live view of cache-owned memory.
- **`keys.PrefixUpperBound` had the bug it exists to prevent** (#816, #819) —
  in both directions. The STO-11 helper kept trailing 0xFF bytes after its
  carry, admitting a neighbouring prefix's keyspace for ~1 prefix in 256
  (loose-bound rate, not loss rate: with ULID-shaped keys an actual crossing
  needs a ~2⁻⁶⁴ id collision — structural hygiene on a delete path, stated
  accurately). `AssocFwdRangeEnd` open-coded the opposite: an inverted carry
  that stopped short. Both now carry and truncate correctly, with the helper
  as the single implementation.
- **Symmetric archive restore, a hard dedup cap, and sweep-path coverage**
  (#806, #728, #696). An archived symmetric association is now stored under
  both endpoints in the same batch that archives it, so the existing restore
  scan finds it from either side (STO-19; directional edges are never
  mirrored, per COG-31). `MaxDedup` is now a hard per-run cap — a large
  cluster can no longer overshoot the configured limit, and dedup no longer
  re-scans already-archived engrams forever. And the sweep path gained the
  real-store regression test that would have caught the #692 truncation.
- **CGDN was inert at any positive threshold** (#768, #805).
  `computeComponents` never set the `ContentMatch` its abstention gate
  multiplies by, so the experimental mode has never returned a live result —
  the same shape as the dead traversal phase (#801). Kept and labelled INERT
  rather than deleted (it has real per-vault config and transport surface;
  deletion would silently orphan explicit config), pinned by a test whose RED
  control is the threshold-0.0 path that does produce output. Corrected in
  passing: the live CGDN ratio is bounded ≤ 1 by construction; #768's 8649.0
  came from the shadow path. #805's ε=0.01 Hebbian rescue floor sits 20×
  above the measured steady-state edge weight (p50 0.0005) — a second,
  independent no-op — and is folded into the same disposition.
- **Six narrow defects closed together** (#776, #794, #700, #733, #821,
  #807): the COG-28 shadow scorer honored the tag-pool bypass its own
  doctrine forbids; a version chain over the depth cap was indistinguishable
  from "no current version exists" and never warned; `annotate:true`'s
  fallback filled annotations from a raw reverse-edge lookup, leaking
  lease-hidden / soft-deleted / as-of-future IDs around the COG-22 visibility
  gate; the scheduled markdown export read every engram without `ReadOnly`,
  reinforcing access counts and flattening ACT-R base-level vault-wide
  (export is observation, not use); a renamed constant left the
  `scoringmeasure` harness uncompilable under vet; and `muninn_forget`
  hard-coded `Hard: false`, silently downgrading an SDK caller's `hard=true`
  to a soft delete — MCP now honors it at the same authorization level gRPC
  has always used, still refused for append-mode credentials (SEC-15).
- **Three enrichment failure paths turned a transient error into a lasting
  one** (#605, #642, #658). The embed-failed and enrich-failed digest flags
  literally aliased the same bit, so a transient embed failure was recorded
  as a permanent enrich failure and vice versa — the flags byte is widened to
  two with a tolerant legacy decode, no repair pass needed (STO-16). A
  caller's own cancellation counted against the provider circuit breaker
  (`Breaker.DoIgnoring` closes that, releasing the half-open probe slot
  rather than stranding recovery). And the embed sub-call consumed the whole
  recall deadline on a hung backend, so the BM25 fallback that existed for
  exactly that case had no budget left to run — it now reserves a fraction of
  the remaining deadline, not a fixed duration.
- **Four cluster/storage divergence bugs** (#686, #760, #771, #761). The
  evolve/startup-repair batch path never replicated to followers — every
  other write method did. Association-weight decay ran independently on
  every node, landing different float32 weights for the same edge (now
  gated on the single-writer gate, like the log prune; followers receive the
  leader's decayed weights via ordinary replication). `link()` at a weight
  already carrying an edge of a different `RelType` silently replaced it —
  now refused (`ErrAssocRelTypeCollision`; putting RelType in the key is a
  named deferral, STO-15). And the repair watermarks gained an operator
  reset path.
- **Cluster role flaps no longer crash the process, and a node's identity
  survives a hostname change** (#629, #630). Promotion and demotion callbacks
  are serialized behind one mutex with panic recovery — demotion previously
  fired in a bare goroutine against shared cognitive-worker state, and an
  unrecovered panic there took the whole process down under flapping quorum.
  Node identity is now persisted to `{dataDir}/node-identity` instead of
  re-derived from the hostname, so a renamed container no longer mints a
  ghost cluster member that poisons quorum counting and pins
  `MinReplicatedSeq` forever. Existing ghosts are NOT auto-reaped (a past
  self and a real peer are indistinguishable without an operator);
  `muninn cluster remove-node` remains the cleanup.
- **The replication log is actually pruned, bounded by a backlog ceiling**
  (#724, #725). `Prune` was implemented, documented, and had no production
  caller — measured on a production primary: ~10 GB/day of log growth,
  311 MB → 18 GB in 8 days on an otherwise idle daemon. It is now wired into
  the periodic prune, made encoding-aware (it decodes and deletes only what
  is provably a log entry — receipts shared the range, so a blind
  `DeleteRange` was never safe), and bounded by
  `ClusterConfig.MaxLogBacklog` (default 50,000) so one Lobe that never
  catches up cannot pin the watermark and grow the Cortex forever — a
  left-behind Lobe rejoins via snapshot, which is strictly better than
  unbounded retention. `0` restores the old behaviour.
- **`muninn upgrade` is now safe to run — and to undo** (#600, completing the
  checksum work in #666). It refuses to self-update when a service manager
  owns the daemon, before any destructive step — on the old code a systemd
  unit was left serving off a deleted inode while the CLI reported the new
  version (#749). It preserves the outgoing binary as `muninn.<version>.bak`
  and refuses the upgrade if it cannot. And its "Stopping daemon..." step no
  longer prints success while a daemon it failed to stop survives (#792) —
  detection now reaches supervisor-started daemons via the exe scan, with
  the darwin/launchd gap named rather than glossed.
- **A cloned vault's `LastAccess` decoded to the year 1754, silently emptying
  the clone's first recall** (#810). `CloneVaultData` wrote the Go zero time
  straight to disk, bypassing the one normalization guard; ERF stores
  `UnixNano()`, for which year 1 is out of range, so it overflowed to a bit
  pattern that decodes as 1754 — a valid `time.Time` that `IsZero()` waves
  through. On a weighted_sum vault recency collapsed to the floor and the
  FIRST recall on a fresh clone returned zero results, silently, re-arming on
  every restart and cache eviction. Three-part fix: `normalizeEngramTimes`
  is now the single definition of "created, never accessed" for every writer
  including clone; the overflow pattern is mapped back to the zero time at
  the ERF decode boundary, making the sentinel unrepresentable; and the
  census test that should have caught it now does.
- **`muninn_where_left_off` works on a cloned or merged vault** (#811): the
  LastAccess index backing it was not carried by clone or merge; the
  post-operation reindex now rebuilds it alongside FTS and HNSW.
- **The web console reports the daemon's authoritative cognitive worker
  state** (#645) instead of a client-side inference.

### Changed

- **`muninn_evolve` now rejects a `tags` argument** with JSON-RPC `-32602`,
  naming `muninn_update_tags` in the error message. Previously it accepted
  `tags` and silently discarded them, returning success with no signal the
  tags were dropped — so a caller could see success, see a `concept` change
  in the same call take effect, and never learn the tags didn't. This is a
  behavior change: a call combining `new_content` with `tags` used to
  *partially* succeed — the content evolution landed and only the tags were
  dropped — and now fails outright. Nothing that previously worked *completely*
  breaks; partially-succeeding calls now fail loudly instead. (#720)

### Internal

- The cognition trial's machinery: a build-tagged (`cognitiontrial`) offline
  harness that puts the Hebbian / PAS / ACT-R base-level layer on trial against
  real recorded queries, a co-activation replay driver, and the pre-registered
  acceptance rule as executable code with its own unit tests. None of it
  compiles into a shipped binary.
- The trial's acceptance rule was made coherent BEFORE any trial data exists
  (#798): the SHIP verdict now requires the shuffled-seed null to have
  actually run, K4 reports but no longer gates, and an exact-zero
  mechanism-delta series is classified UNDERPOWERED rather than counted as a
  kill vote.
- `phase4HebbianBoost`'s recency constant is named for what it is —
  `recencyTau`, a decay time constant, not a half-life (#799). Pure rename,
  byte-identical measurement outputs verified before/after.
- Reinforcement tests drain the fire-and-forget worker deterministically
  instead of polling a 15-second wall clock (#813) — the flake had already
  had its deadline raised once, which moved the rate, not the mode.
- CI guards grew teeth: the leak-tell check runs against every change's added
  lines and the pre-commit vault-guard gap for worktrees and contributor
  clones is closed (#845); a NUL byte can no longer make git classify a
  tracked source file as binary and invisible to diff review (#827); and the
  claims-and-evidence convention — "a claim that reads the same when it is
  false is not a claim" — is now written down with its two measured
  counterexamples (#812, #814).
- The decision record gained three measured negatives and the
  associative-traversal post-mortem (#801, #837): honest negatives are
  first-class outcomes here, and the record is where they live.

### Security

- **Entity records were global across vaults — a cross-tenant read oracle AND
  a cross-tenant write** (#683). The 0x1F entity record was keyed by name
  hash alone, with no vault prefix, while every index backing it carried the
  vault — so two vaults that mentioned the same entity name shared ONE
  record. Three live consequences: `mention_count` summed every vault's
  upserts (and entity IDF divided that cross-vault numerator by a
  single-vault denominator); a by-name lookup from a vault with NO links to
  an entity still returned another tenant's name, type, confidence,
  first_seen and count — an existence-and-metadata oracle over another
  vault's entity vocabulary; and `SetEntityState` took no vault at all, so an
  agent scoped to vault A could mark vault B's entity deprecated or merged.
  Entity records are now keyed `0x1F|vault|nameHash` and every read/write
  path takes the vault. **Migration v6** relocates existing records to every
  vault that positively references them, recomputing `mention_count` from
  each vault's own links — counts go DOWN, because the old figure was an
  upsert counter that re-enrichment, replay and merges each inflated.
  Unreferenced records are dropped with a WARN naming each one; deletion is
  key-by-key behind a conjunctive positive test, never a range delete, and a
  re-run never clobbers existing output.
- **CLI cluster commands now authenticate** (#632). `muninn cluster ...` sent
  no credential at all against endpoints that require the cluster secret or
  an admin session. Fixed by extending the two auth mechanisms `muninn vault`
  already uses rather than inventing a third: the cluster secret is read from
  the local `cluster.yaml`, and enable/disable run the same admin
  authentication flow as `vault`.
- **Enrichment and embed errors no longer carry memory content** (#641,
  #790). Enrichment parse failures embedded up to 160 bytes of the model's
  response in the returned error — and `Run` logs every failed stage at WARN
  on a default-configured server, so fragments of user memories reached the
  logs (model output is a function of memory content). Parse errors now carry
  a stage and a stable category (`unmarshal_failure`, `type_mismatch`,
  `empty_result`), never payload bytes. All seven embed providers had the
  same shape — the raw HTTP error body, which echoes the request body, IS the
  memory text — and now use the same mechanism.
- **`muninn upgrade` renders the release note inertly** (#857). The note
  comes from a GitHub Release body and reached the terminal verbatim, where
  an ESC byte is an escape sequence that can recolour, reposition, or
  overwrite what a reviewer saw on the release page. C0/C1/DEL are stripped
  (tab and newline kept); a lone invalid byte still renders as U+FFFD rather
  than being dropped, pinned by test so a future tightening cannot quietly
  start discarding legitimate malformed text.
- **`muninn_state` is no longer callable by an observe-mode credential.** The
  tool was classified in `isReadOnlyTool`, but its handler reaches
  `Engine.UpdateLifecycleState` (via `mcpEngineAdapter.UpdateState`) — so an
  `mk_` key or `cap_` token issued as read-only could transition any engram's
  lifecycle state, including archiving it. It is now classified mutating. Effects
  per credential mode:
  - **observe — now denied.** A read-only client that was calling `muninn_state`
    was performing a write and will now receive `forbidden`.
  - **write — now allowed** (it was previously *denied*, because write mode
    admits only tools classified mutating). This is a side effect of the
    two-bucket classifier, not a designed grant: `mutatingTools` and
    `readOnlyTools` are complementary over every registered tool — enforced by
    the census in `internal/mcp/tool_classification_test.go`, not true by
    construction — so a tool cannot be denied to observe *and* write.

    It grants write mode a second tool for a capability it already held, not a
    new capability. `muninn_compare_and_set` has been classified mutating since
    before this change, its `set_state` enum includes `archived`, and
    `expect_state` is optional (the tool schema says "Omit to skip the guard"),
    so it reaches the identical `store.CompareAndSet` lifecycle transition
    unconditionally. Write mode also already holds every other mutating tool —
    `muninn_forget`, `muninn_evolve`, `muninn_trust`, `muninn_merge_entity`
    among them — with the single exception of `muninn_create_workflow_vault`,
    which `server.go` pins to a full-mode `mk_` key by a separate guard.
    `handleState`'s response echoes only caller-supplied values, so it opens no
    exfiltration channel.

    **One property of archive is worse than its neighbours and is named rather
    than glossed:** `state(archived)` is the only write-mode operation that
    leaves no *enumerable* trace. `muninn_list_deleted` reads
    `StateSoftDeleted` only and recall refuses archived engrams on every path,
    so where a `forget` is findable through `list_deleted` and an `evolve`
    through `as_of`/`include_invalid`, an archived engram is reachable only
    from an ID the caller already holds. It is not silent and not
    irreversible — `Engine.Restore` accepts `StateArchived` — but its audit
    trail is a content-free `update-meta` provenance entry, and the `reason`
    argument the tool advertises is discarded by both the MCP and REST adapters
    (`Engine.UpdateLifecycleState` has no such parameter). By contrast
    `muninn_merge_entity`, which write mode has always held, is outright
    irreversible. All of these properties are pre-existing and untouched here.

    **Residual, tracked separately (#822):** MCP write mode is broader than
    REST write mode, but not for the reason the route shapes suggest. REST's
    `ReadOnlyGuard(WriteOnlyGuard(...))` on `PUT /api/engrams/{id}/state` is
    documented in `internal/transport/rest/server.go` as exfiltration
    prevention for routes that "return engram data in their response body" —
    and REST write mode is separately *allowed* to soft-delete
    (`TestWriteOnlyMode_WriteHandlersNotBlocked/DeleteEngram`), which is more
    destructive than archiving. Closing the real gap needs a full-only overlay
    consulted before the `ModeWrite` case, whose membership must cover every
    write-mode path to a lifecycle transition — `muninn_state` *and*
    `muninn_compare_and_set`, then a decision about `muninn_claim`/
    `muninn_release`, which share the CAS primitive. That is a scoping
    decision, not a one-name move, and REST exposes no compare-and-set route
    to take parity from. Pinned meanwhile by
    `TestDispatch_WriteMode_AllowsCompareAndSetArchive`.
  - **append — now denied at the MCP dispatch gate** as well as by the existing
    `Engine.refuseAppend` backstop, which is why append mode was never
    exploitable. Two layers again instead of one.
  - **full — unaffected.**
  (#731)

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-01

The trust release. Nine rounds of blind hands-on evaluation by AI agents drove
this cycle: each round's top complaint was fixed, adversarially reviewed, and
re-verified live by the evaluator that filed it.

### The cognitive substrate, made honest

- **Full-confidence learning restored** (#757): a key-encoding overflow had sent
  every weight-1.0 association (declared links, decide evidence, LTP-saturated
  learning) to the wrong key position since inception, where it read back as 0.
  "Strengthens with use" works for the first time. A startup repair (#759)
  relocates identifiable pre-fix keys, watermarked and gated so decay cannot
  destroy the evidence first.
- **Association decay is a real forgetting curve** (#766): decay was a per-pass
  multiplier on a 60-second tick (a 13.5-minute half-life) since February; every
  learned edge hit the floor within an hour of last use. Now a peak-anchored
  elapsed-time ceiling (default 30-day half-life, `assoc_half_life_days`),
  cadence-independent by construction, no on-disk format change. A legacy
  `assoc_decay_factor` in (0,1) is reinterpreted per-day with a one-time loud
  WARN; a factor of 1.0 or above skips loudly instead of silently enabling.
- **Contradictions stopped destroying data** (#747) and started mattering
  (#772): declaring a `contradicts` link now changes what recall returns — both
  sides demoted and annotated, a response-level `conflict` block, and every
  resolution path (evolve, forget(not_true_since), link(supersedes)) actually
  clears it, immediately, in recall and in the report. The shared worker's flush
  ticker was a debounce that starved detection (and the confidence penalty)
  under any active session; fixed.

### Recall that tells the truth

- **Version chains resolve to their head** (#767): a query phrased in a
  superseded fact's old wording returns the current version, attributed
  (`substituted_for`, `substitution_basis`), with fork/cycle refusal and loud
  truncation. Evolve now wakes the embed processor, closing a ~3-minute window
  where a fresh successor was semantically invisible.
- **A first-class relevance band** (#778): every recall row carries
  `relevance_band` (strong/moderate/weak/filter_match/uncalibrated) derived
  from the absolute score against the vault's own calibration — the per-query
  score renormalization can no longer dress a weak neighbor as certainty.
  `absolute_score` and `content_match` are now visible on the wire. The
  response-level "nothing strongly matched" hint deliberately did not ship: it
  failed its pre-committed acceptance rule (16.7% vs 70%), and that record is
  pinned in CI.
- **Calibrated abstention** (#715, #718, #754): recall can honestly abstain
  (`abstained`, `abstained_reason`) with an anisotropy-calibrated semantic
  floor, self-measured per model; embedding failure degrades loudly
  (`semantic_degraded`, #740). RRF vaults no longer return silently-empty
  default recall (#705); recall-mode presets no longer bypass the mode-aware
  threshold (#710); top-N ordering is deterministic (#699).
- **Currency advisories stopped lying** (#738, #758): the version-cluster
  advisory ships with a universal version-marker gate and declared-chain
  suppression — a deliberate near-silencing on vaults without version
  vocabulary, because a false "possibly superseded" on a live fact is worse
  than silence.

### The write path and the agent experience

- **The Push, increment 1** (#694): armed intentions with focal-cue notices
  over MCP, behind `MUNINN_PROSPECTIVE`.
- **Curator reflex in the on-connect surface** (#741) and evolve-first guidance
  (#723); six silent-substitution defects from hands-on evaluation fixed in one
  pass (#746); unrecognized memory types (#742) and link relations (#745) are
  never silently swallowed; the entity-type enum that cost 64 points of entity
  coverage is gone (#743); evolve records its real write verb in provenance
  (#739); optional inline entities on evolve (#680); importance dimension with
  pruning protection (#689); per-vault exclude-tags (#735).
- **muninn_remember names the vault it resolved to** when the caller omits one
  (#772 rider).

### Operations, safety, durability

- Consolidate no longer loses data under concurrent writes (#754). Stale PID
  files no longer break `muninn stop` (#650). Trigger events carry the full
  vault prefix (#697). Backup/import test hardening (#753), hermeticity
  doctrine for async assertions (#727), and four CI timing flakes fixed at the
  cause. Privacy: design records triaged with a public-repo naming rule
  enforced by a reviewer-level check (#775, #734).

### Known and named

- The recall gate's answerability ceiling is measured, in-tree, and honest:
  topically-adjacent unanswerable queries pass at high rates because they carry
  real evidence; no scalar gate fixes this (#757's labeled query set). The
  abstain-on-weak default both evaluators now ask for is the next increment's
  question, gated by that measurement.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-20

Adds an agent-oriented credential and multi-agent workflow layer (capability
tokens and self-provisioned workflow vaults), a `working` plasticity preset,
recall-event calibration ground truth, and a `muninn remember` CLI write verb,
alongside a keyspace-collision fix that ships a one-time on-disk migration.

> **Upgrade note — on-disk migration.** This release relocates the auth
> subsystem's internal Pebble key prefixes to resolve a latent collision with
> storage keys (#611). A one-time v3 migration rewrites existing admin-user,
> API-key, and vault-config records on the first start after upgrade. It is
> idempotent and crash-safe, but **back up your data directory before
> upgrading**, as with any storage-format change. No action is needed beyond
> starting the new binary.

### Added

- **Capability tokens (`cap_`) and agent-provisioned workflow vaults.** A new
  TTL-bound, MCP-only credential type plus a `muninn_create_workflow_vault` tool
  that lets an agent mint a scoped, expiring `wf-*` vault for a fleet.
  Capabilities are structurally non-recursive (a capability can never mint
  another) and the tool is opt-in (`MUNINN_AGENT_VAULT_CREATE`, default off).
  (#612, RFC #597)
- **Toolset profiles for `tools/list`.** A `core`/`full` switch via the
  `MUNINN_MCP_TOOLSET` env var or a per-connection `X-Muninn-Toolset` header
  trims the advertised tool set to cut per-session schema overhead. Advertisement
  only — every tool stays callable. Defaults to `full`, fails open on unknown
  values. (#604, implements #588)
- **`working` plasticity preset.** `default` cognition (Hebbian + PAS on) plus a
  7-day retention window, so a shared workflow vault auto-evaporates through the
  background pruner. (#599, RFC #597)
- **Recall-event sink.** The set of engrams surfaced by each recall is persisted
  as calibration ground truth, behind a purpose-gated read allowlist so it can
  never leak back into recall, replicated like every other write, and cleared
  with its vault. (#574, closes #573)
- **`muninn remember` CLI verb.** Store a memory against a running daemon over
  the REST surface, with `--content-file` for large or JSON-fragile payloads,
  authenticating from a `0600` key file. (#613, closes #610)
- **Stored memory type surfaced on reads.** `read`, `recall`, `where_left_off`,
  and `find_by_entity` now return the stored `memory_type` and `type_label`.
  (#616)
- **Search Scoring setting** in the management console. (#590)

### Changed

- **Auth Pebble key prefixes relocated (`0x11`–`0x14` → `0x42`–`0x45`),**
  resolving a latent collision with storage keys in the shared database (see the
  upgrade note above). Ships a v3 on-disk migration and a cross-package
  prefix-disjointness test so the collision class can't recur. (#618, closes
  #611)

### Fixed

- **Tag-scoped recall no longer silently misses engrams.** `tags_all` /
  `tags_any` were post-filters over the candidate pool; they now seed candidates
  from the tag index, so a tagged engram can no longer be structurally absent
  from a tag-scoped recall. (#619, closes #607)
- **Revoked or expired `mk_` API keys can no longer keep dispatching on an open
  MCP SSE session.** The cached session credential is re-validated on every POST,
  symmetric with the existing `cap_` re-validation. (#617, RFC #597; see
  Security)
- **Late HNSW inserts stay reachable.** A node born with zero in-edges could be
  permanently unfindable; the fresh back-edge is now protected during prune and
  small orphan sets are repaired on load. (#621, closes #620)
- **Explicit recall threshold preserved under RRF fusion** instead of being
  clobbered to the RRF floor. (#590)
- **`DeleteEngram` serialized with `CompareAndSet`'s per-engram stripe lock,**
  closing a race that could resurrect a just-deleted engram. (#594)

### Security

- **Revoked `mk_` MCP SSE sessions closed.** A revoked or expired API key could
  keep serving a long-lived SSE session; it is now re-validated on every POST
  before dispatch. (#617)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Atomic compare-and-set + ownership lease on engrams.** A low-level CAS
  primitive (`PebbleStore.CompareAndSet`), layered into an advisory ownership
  lease (`Claim`/`Release`), giving a fleet of agents sharing a vault
  work-queue semantics — no two agents grab the same item. Closes a
  pre-existing lifecycle-state TOCTOU as a side effect. (#576, closes #548)
- **Fuzzy entity resolve behind exact `find_by_entity` lookup.** Exact match
  is tried first; fuzzy token-set-containment matching is the fallback, not
  the default, avoiding over-eager matches. (#571, #572, tightened in #581)
- **Vault dimension guard.** Each vault's embedding dimension is established
  atomically on first insert and enforced on every write path. On mismatch,
  recall degrades to BM25-only instead of silently mixing embedding spaces.
  (#589, closes #582)
- **User-supplied local ONNX embedding model.** New `embed_model_path` /
  `embed_tokenizer_path` config lets operators point at their own model
  instead of the bundled one; dimension is probed via real inference at
  init, never hardcoded. (#589, closes #583)
- **`vault plasticity` CLI command** to get/set per-vault plasticity
  settings. (#551)
- **`multi_user` vault setting** with shared-vault session-start guidance.
  (#575)
- **gRPC `ListVaults` and `BatchForget` RPCs**, with per-item vault
  resolution and auth requirements. (#557, #558)

### Fixed

- **Embed provider silent fallback eliminated.** An explicitly configured
  embed provider is never silently substituted for a different model. (#585)
- **BM25 fallback when the embed backend is unreachable**, with precise
  `-32602` error messages instead of an opaque failure. (#578)
- **Plasticity panel reset.** Advanced plasticity overrides no longer leak
  stale values into the save payload when the panel is collapsed. (#579)
- **CLI joined `exec:`/`logs:` tokens** now route to their handlers instead
  of being misparsed. (#580)
- **Idempotent write paths.** Idempotency keys are wired through gRPC and
  REST write paths and deduped within a batch. (#560, plus follow-up fix)
- **Entity scan dedup** by normalized identity instead of raw casing.
- **HNSW graph rebuild** from vectors when the restored structure is
  disconnected.
- **`vault create` registration** in the Pebble index, repairing a
  split-brain window in reindex-fts/export. (#547)
- **Google enrichment truncation.** The Google provider's `MaxOutputTokens`
  was raised from 4096 to 8192, and LLM parse failures are now counted in the
  stats, so long enrichments are no longer silently truncated.

### Security

- Bump Go toolchain to 1.26.5, fixing [GO-2026-5856](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5856)
  (Encrypted Client Hello privacy leak in `crypto/tls`), reachable via the gRPC
  server, MCP server, WAL recovery, `doctor` cert dial, and plugin transport.
  (#591)

> **Correction (see #602):** the originally-tagged 0.8.0 changelog listed an
> entity-boost recall-flood fix (#569) under Fixed. That fix did not make the
> 0.8.0 cut — #569 remains open and its PR (#570) is still in review — so the

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-12

The headline of this release is a complete overhaul of the cluster subsystem.
The Cortex/Lobe replication layer existed in previous releases but was not
reliably functional in real multi-node deployments. Every known correctness
issue has been addressed and Docker-validated end-to-end. High-availability
deployments are now production-ready.

### Added

- **Automatic failover.** When the Cortex goes down, Lobes detect SDOWN via
  gossip, accumulate votes, and the first node with quorum wins a jittered
  Raft-style election. Failover completes without operator intervention. (#532)
- **Returning-primary deference.** A restarted former Cortex probes the cluster
  before asserting leadership. If a failover leader is already in place, it
  defers, receives a snapshot, and follows — no split-brain, no data loss. (#537)
- **PeerHello discovery mesh.** Nodes with no join relationship (two primaries,
  sentinels) dial configured seeds and exchange authenticated `PeerHello` frames
  to establish identified connections, feeding MSP liveness and elections. (#530)
- **Equal-epoch tie-break.** When two primaries discover each other at the same
  epoch (split-brain bootstrap), the lower node-id keeps leadership and the
  other demotes cleanly. (#530)
- **Periodic quorum-loss self-demotion.** A Cortex that loses quorum demotes
  itself on a configurable interval. Recovery is automatic — once quorum is
  restored, it re-elects at a fresh epoch. Gated by a `hadQuorum` latch to
  prevent false demotion during bootstrap. (#527)
- **`muninn_evolve` concept rename.** The `concept` field is now an optional
  parameter. Omit to inherit the predecessor's label verbatim (existing
  behavior); supply a new string to rename it. Fixes the class of orientation
  bugs where a concept encoding mutable state ("answer owed", "PR blocked")
  could never be corrected without destroying the ULID lineage. (#483)
- **Server-side tag filters on recall.** `tags_all`, `tags_any`, and
  `tag_filter` (key-prefix + lexical bounds) are now first-class params on
  `muninn_recall`. Composes with semantic search and temporal filters. (#479)
- **SSE push re-evaluation on embed.** A `PushOnWrite` subscription that
  couldn't match at write time (vector score was 0, embedding not yet ready)
  is re-evaluated once the retroactive processor inserts the embedding. Fires
  exactly once; deduplicates against write-time deliveries. (#512)

### Fixed

- **Demotion zombie eliminated.** After demotion the Cortex goroutine previously
  parked at `<-ctx.Done()`, leaving the node in a half-leader state. Replaced
  with a supervisor state machine (`modeLeading / modeFollowing /
  modeWaitingQuorum`) that drives correct transitions. (#526)
- **Convergent failover election.** Stale connections from the old topology were
  not evicted after a failover, causing new join attempts to land on dead peers.
  Leader-gated joins, `ClearLeader` on ODOWN, and `EvictIfConn` on connection
  death bring the cluster to a stable single-leader state reliably. (#535, #536)
- **Lobe identity reconciliation on join.** A Lobe that reconnected under a
  different address was registered as a new member while the old entry persisted,
  inflating membership counts and breaking quorum calculations. (#524)
- **Voter count in `HandleVoteResponse`** — only registered voters counted,
  resolving phantom-voter quorum inflation. (#525)
- **Cluster topology in `/v1/cluster/info`** was reporting stale or incorrect
  member lists after topology changes. (#518)
- **Lobe replication stream.** A Lobe was closing the join connection
  immediately after handshake; the Cortex streams replication entries over the
  same connection, so the stream was immediately broken. (#515)
- **JoinRequest.Role HMAC coverage.** The join HMAC covered only `node_id`,
  leaving the `Role` field unauthenticated. Protocol v2 covers `nodeID + role`;
  v1 nodes remain accepted during rolling upgrades. (#539)

### Internal

- MSP `odownFired` latch prevents duplicate ODOWN callbacks per episode.
- `connKind` priority ordering (`kindJoin > kindHello > kindSeed`) prevents
  inferior connections from evicting established ones.
- TCP keepalive (15 s) set on all adopted peer connections.
- MBP protocol version bumped to 2.

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-11

Hotfix release for issues found in production immediately after v0.6.2. Every
fix ships with a regression test.

### Fixed
- **Multi-phrase semantic recall returned 0 results.** For a `context` of 2+
  phrases, the query embedding was the flat N×dim concatenation of the
  per-phrase vectors, fed to the dim-sized HNSW index — so the cosine length
  guard zeroed every score. The query embedding is now mean-pooled into a single
  dim-sized vector. Single-phrase recall was unaffected. (#498)
- **`merge_entity` on case-variant names destroyed engram links.** Entity names
  are hashed case-insensitively, so merging "Foo" into "foo" made source and
  target the same key; the relink batch's Set+Delete then silently removed the
  link to both casings. Now guarded at both the merge and relink layers. (#503)
- **SSE push events were never delivered to SDK clients.** The server read
  `on_write` while all SDKs send `push_on_write`; the status recorder also
  lacked `Unwrap()`, killing SSE streams at the write deadline. Both fixed, plus
  the Python SDK now parses the nested `engram` push payload. (#437)
- **Inline-enriched memories were reported as un-enriched forever.**
  Caller-supplied summary/relationships/type now set the matching digest flags,
  so the enrichment-candidates query no longer returns them. (#500)
- **HNSW: a failed index load was cached as a permanently empty index.** The
  load is now retried on the next access; load outcomes are logged; the restore
  iterator is scoped to the vault. (#499)
- **`muninn_recall` serialization.** `content` no longer duplicates `summary`,
  lifecycle `state` is populated, and scores no longer carry float32 noise. (#502)
- **Local embedder mislabeled.** It was labeled `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` but is
  `bge-small-en-v1.5`; additionally the Windows release binary shipped MiniLM
  bytes under BGE pooling. Both corrected. (#455)
- **Failed LLM-enrichment init now surfaces the real error** instead of
  reporting only "Not configured". (#453)
- **Entity-type validation is now consistent** across `remember`,
  `entity_state`, and `apply_enrichment` (normalize + coerce on every
  user-facing path). (#501)

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-10

### Security
- **Vault isolation on the binary transports** — MBP (8474) and gRPC (8477) now enforce the same fail-closed vault model as REST/MCP: a keyed session is pinned to its key's vault (cross-vault access rejected, even to a public vault), an unauthenticated session may reach only public vaults, and a missing auth store fails closed (#484).
- **LLM provider API keys masked** in the admin plugin-config API; a retyped key is saved, an untouched (masked) field is preserved (#488).
- **Installer checksum verification** — releases now publish `checksums.txt`; `install.sh` / `install.ps1` verify the downloaded binary and refuse to install on mismatch (#489).
- **Startup warning** when bound to a non-loopback address while the admin still has the default password (#490).

### Added
- TLS is now a first-class mode (epic #443): TLS setup in `muninn init` (#465), `muninn doctor` self-describes TLS state / bind addresses / cert details (#463), startup cert-expiry warning (#456), `docs/tls.md` + TLS-aware systemd unit (#466), Web UI host derived from the cert DNS SAN (#467).

### Changed
- Scheme-aware CLI URLs and clients throughout — printed URLs, generated AI-tool configs, and admin/vault HTTP clients honour `https` under TLS (#468, #469, #478); `muninn status` distinguishes a TLS trust failure from a dead server and no longer reads an all-cert-failure as "stopped" (#477, #481).
- `muninn.env` is loaded before every subcommand, so lifecycle/status commands share the daemon's config (#476).
- Activity chart buckets by the viewer's local calendar day (#458).
- `go` directive bumped to 1.26.4 to clear govulncheck stdlib advisories (#464).

### Fixed
- **HNSW graph integrity** — link-before-promote, distance-based neighbor pruning, vault-scoped index load, and back-edge persistence; repairs silent degradation of semantic recall to a single reachable cluster (#471, also resolves #462).
- `Evolve` no longer appends ` (evolved)` to the concept; lineage stays in the supersedes graph (#459).
- Renamed-vault correctness — bulk vault operations and FTS reindex resolve the stored workspace prefix instead of the SipHash of the current name (#454, #480).
- Consolidation dedup no longer mutates the cache-shared representative engram in place — was a data race against concurrent recalls (#492).
- Decay/recency scoring clamps clock skew — a future `LastAccess`/`CreatedAt` no longer pushes retention above 1 (#493).
- Memory detail panel "Created: Invalid Date" for search results (#461).

### Internal
- `storage.ErrNotFound` sentinel replaces `strings.Contains(err, "not found")` matching at the engine boundary (#491).
- De-flaked the WAL syncer timing tests (#486).

### Upgrade notes
- The HNSW fix (#471) repairs the indexing algorithm but not graphs already degraded on disk by the old defects. If semantic recall has been returning too few results, run one `muninn vault reembed <vault>` per affected vault on this build to rebuild a correct graph.

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- `fix(cluster)` — defer the `OnLobeJoined` callback until the `JoinResponse` + snapshot are fully on the wire, so the streamer no longer races the handshake and corrupts the lobe-side parser (#449, #448 Bug 1).
- `fix(cli)` — auto-detect TLS in `muninn status` / `muninn start` health probes (#444).

### Changed
- `feat(consolidation)` — the representative node absorbs the `AccessCount` of merged duplicates during dedup (#447).
- `feat(enrichment)` — Gemini 2.5 Flash added as a Google enrichment option and promoted to the default Google model (#450, #452).
- `chore(consolidation)` — dedup metadata-update errors are now surfaced in the consolidation report (#451).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Audit logging** — structured audit trail with file, stdout, syslog, and webhook sinks; `audit tail/export/stats` CLI commands (#418).
- **Retrieval annotations** — staleness, conflict, and trust metadata on recall responses (#388).
- **MCP `initialize` instructions** response.

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart worker goroutines after a panic; include the field byte in the BM25 posting key (multi-field terms were silently overwritten); scope the IDF cache per `(vault, term)` (#430).
- `fix(storage)` — vault deletion now clears all per-vault prefixes and entity-graph data and prunes orphaned global entity records (#435, #436, #438).
- `fix(cli)` — `muninn status` / `start` probes honour `MUNINNDB_{ADMIN,MCP,UI}_URL` (#439, #440).
- `fix(engine)` — content-hash dedup race, enrichment ghost-queue deadlock, trigger nil-metadata crash.
- `fix(auth)` — validate the Bearer token before parsing the body to prevent DoS amplification (#416).
- `fix(import)` — pipe deadlock and orphaned vault name on a failed import (#412).

### Security
- gRPC bumped to v1.79.3; govulncheck added to CI.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart FTS worker goroutines after a panic (a panicked worker was never replaced, eventually making all new writes unsearchable until restart); include the field byte in the BM25 posting key; scope the IDF cache by `(vault, term)` (#430).

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Per-engram trust/taint labels** (#387) — `TrustLevel` (`verified`/`inferred`/`external`/`untrusted`) stored at a fixed ERF offset (zero-migration); all writes auto-stamp `inferred`; trust is visible in `muninn_read`/`muninn_recall`; new `muninn_trust` MCP tool; `ExcludeUntrusted` per-vault plasticity option.
- **Cursor pagination** for `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` so large vaults no longer miss candidates (#362).

### Fixed
- `fix(engine)` — 400 for invalid inline association target IDs (#399).
- `fix(rest)` — 400 instead of 500 for invalid engram IDs in `/api/link` (#395).
- `fix(enrich)` — prevent infinite retry loops that deadlocked the circuit breaker (#390).
- `fix(trigger)` — guard against nil metadata in `sweepVault` / `handleCognitive` (#393).
- `fix(activation)` — restore the RRF score for BFS-traversed candidates in the ACT-R/CGDN paths.
- `fix(rest)` — delete phantom vaults that existed only in auth config.

### Internal
- `refactor(auth)` — extract `ParseBearerToken`, `ValidateStaticToken`, `IsValidVaultName` into the shared `internal/auth` package.

---

## [0.4.12-alpha] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **MCP vault-isolation bypass** — `mk_` vault-scoped keys now enforce vault pinning in open-server mode (no static token); previously any MCP caller could reach any vault by naming it. Invalid/revoked `mk_` keys fail closed; SSE message-endpoint auth re-validation tightened (#368).

---

## [0.4.11-alpha] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** — Hebbian associations strengthen over repeated co-activation; configurable via plasticity config.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** scoring strategy, selectable alongside ACT-R and Ebbinghaus.
- **Content-hash deduplication** at write time.
- **Agent-managed enrichment via MCP** — `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` / `muninn_apply_enrichment`.
- **`X-Client-Name: MuninnDB`** header on outbound LLM (embed/enrich) requests.

### Fixed
- **Cluster join handshake (4 bugs)** — register the live `net.Conn` before responding; remove the epoch guard so a Cortex restart re-triggers election; accept both `secret` and `cluster_secret` JSON fields; honour `MUNINN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` at bootstrap.

---

## [0.4.10] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Dashboard activity panel overhaul: selectable timeframe presets (7d–180d, capped at 180 days), end-date picker, dynamic x-axis tick grouping based on chart width, and a raw data table toggle with copy-to-clipboard. Includes loading, error, and empty-state feedback.
- `GET /api/activity-counts` endpoint returning per-day engram creation counts for a vault. Accepts `days` (1–180, default 7) and optional `until` (YYYY-MM-DD) query parameters. Malformed or out-of-range values return 400. Backed by an efficient ULID key-header scan with zero-filled contiguous day ranges.

### Changed
- Web UI: unified tab navigation across Memories, Graph, and Settings pages with a consistent bordered-tab style replacing the previous mix of underline, button, and pill patterns.
- Public vault unauthenticated access now runs in `full` mode. Previously, requests to an open vault with no API key ran as `observe`, silently preventing cognitive-state writes. Public vaults are now genuinely open — callers get `full` access unless they present an explicit `observe` key.

### Fixed
- Native `<select>` dropdowns unreadable in dark mode — `--bg-card` CSS variable was referenced but never defined; added it to both themes and added global select/option styling for proper dark/light rendering.
- Sidebar nav items are now scrollable when viewport height is too small, keeping the logo and footer pinned.
- Collapsed sidebar footer icons no longer overflow into the right border; icons render borderless when collapsed and bordered when expanded.
- "New Vault" action moved from sidebar footer into the vault picker modal to reclaim vertical space for nav items.
- Sidebar footer icons (theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts) replaced with consistent SVG icons matching the existing icon family.
- Version label merged into the footer icon row instead of occupying its own line.
- Sidebar footer padding and gaps tightened to maximize nav item visibility on short viewports.
- Memories page search-mode segmented control (Balanced/Semantic/Recent/Deep) now matches adjacent button height and font size, includes dividers between options, and preserves padding when Alpine.js re-renders dynamic styles.
- Enrich now accepts OpenAI-compatible JSON responses returned in `message.reasoning` when `message.content` is empty, including structured reasoning payloads.
- Retry and retroactive enrichment now only mark entity and relationship stages complete after successful persistence, avoiding partial-state retries, nil-result crashes, and silent graph-write failures.
- Entity and relationship response parsing now rejects nested wrapper keys like `meta.entities` / `meta.relationships` instead of treating them as valid empty results.
- Vault-scoped REST routes now resolve non-default vaults consistently from authenticated request bodies as well as `?vault=`, and reject mismatched query/body vaults.
- Vault-scoped REST routes are setup to deprecate vault passed in the body in a later release.
- REST read responses now include `memory_type: 0` for fact-classified memories instead of omitting the field.
- Observe-mode API keys now return `403` on semantically mutating REST and gRPC routes while preserving access to read-like POST endpoints such as activation, traversal, explanation, and batch link reads.
- ACT-R scoring: `bLevelCap` prevents base-level saturation in fresh vaults; two-pass per-query normalization ensures scores stay in [0, 1] range.
- Archived engrams (dream engine) now filtered at all retrieval points — query, find-by-entity, trigger worker sweeps.
- Dormant flag now gated on `!UseACTR`; in ACT-R mode the flag is derived from activation score rather than the Ebbinghaus relevance field.
- Web UI: form class consistency, segmented control hover state, uniform input/button sizing, memory filter bar density, page title branding, logs page full-width layout, observability view hash routing.
- SSE keepalive uses spec-compliant comment frame (`: keepalive`) to prevent proxy idle timeouts.
- Entity type allowlist expanded from 8 to 14 types; unknown types pass through without coercion.
- Clipboard API guarded by secure-context check with `execCommand` fallback for HTTP installs.
- Pebble `ErrNotFound` distinguished from other errors in embed migration path.

---

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Native TLS support via `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` flags on all 5 client-facing servers
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec served at `GET /api/openapi.yaml` (60+ routes documented)
- API key TTL — optional `expires` field on key creation (`"90d"`, `"1y"`, RFC3339)
- Query timeout enforcement — 30s activation deadline with BFS short-circuit (`MUNINN_ACTIVATE_TIMEOUT`)
- Automated backup scheduler (`--backup-interval`, `--backup-dir`, `--backup-retain`)
- Vault rename — metadata-only rename across storage, engine, REST, CLI, and Web UI
- Contradiction resolution — Keep A, Keep B, Merge, Dismiss actions in Web UI
- CLI: `muninn vault create`, `muninn api-key create|list|revoke`, `muninn admin change-password`
- Web UI: engram edit/evolve, new vault creation, manual link/association creation
- Web UI: vault export/import, FTS reindex, lifecycle state transitions
- Web UI: explain scores ("Why?" button), consolidate, record decision modals
- Web UI: memory filtering and sorting (created/accessed, tags, state, confidence, date range)
- Web UI: keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `n` new, `?` help), tooltips, prev/next navigation
- Web UI: per-engram embedding status indicator, API key expiry column, backup trigger
- Graph: orphan node filtering, zoom controls (+/−/Fit)
- Observability tab in Web UI with live polling
- `GET /api/admin/observability` REST endpoint with full system snapshot
- Per-vault latency tracker with percentile reporting (p50/p95/p99)
- Vault-labeled Prometheus histograms for write/activate/read latency
- `vault reembed` command (CLI, REST, Web UI)
- CHANGELOG.md, encryption at rest documentation, CI OpenAPI spec validation
- PR template with release checklist, hookify drift detection rules
- Branch protection on main (PR + approval + CI) and develop (CI)
- Node SDK publish workflow (OIDC trusted publishing)
- Patent notice (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/991,402)

### Fixed
- ListEngrams now uses passive Pebble scan — no Hebbian side effects on browse
- Explain runs in observe mode — no cognitive mutations on "Why?" clicks
- Session click fetches full engram data + updates URL hash
- Atomic auth config rename (Pebble batch instead of separate Set+Delete)
- Sentinel error `ErrVaultNameCollision` replaces fragile string matching across clone/import/rename
- `parseKeyExpiry` rejects past dates at creation time
- Backup test data race (atomic counter for stubCheckpointer)
- Windowed average calculation in latency tracker
- Unconditional Prometheus metric recording and reembed vault response handling
- MCP vault default fix

---

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- `bge-small-en-v1.5` embedder support as an alternative to the default ONNX embedder
- Recall mode presets exposed in CLI, REST, and Web UI

### Fixed
- Arrow key navigation in the `init` wizard multi-select and single-select prompts

---

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-26

### Added
