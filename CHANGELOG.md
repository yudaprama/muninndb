## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **Vault isolation on the binary transports** — MBP (8474) and gRPC (8477) now enforce the same fail-closed vault model as REST/MCP: a keyed session is pinned to its key's vault (cross-vault access rejected, even to a public vault), an unauthenticated session may reach only public vaults, and a missing auth store fails closed (#484).
- **LLM provider API keys masked** in the admin plugin-config API; a retyped key is saved, an untouched (masked) field is preserved (#488).
- **Installer checksum verification** — releases now publish `checksums.txt`; `install.sh` / `install.ps1` verify the downloaded binary and refuse to install on mismatch (#489).
- **Startup warning** when bound to a non-loopback address while the admin still has the default password (#490).

### Added
- TLS is now a first-class mode (epic #443): TLS setup in `muninn init` (#465), `muninn doctor` self-describes TLS state / bind addresses / cert details (#463), startup cert-expiry warning (#456), `docs/tls.md` + TLS-aware systemd unit (#466), Web UI host derived from the cert DNS SAN (#467).

### Changed
- Scheme-aware CLI URLs and clients throughout — printed URLs, generated AI-tool configs, and admin/vault HTTP clients honour `https` under TLS (#468, #469, #478); `muninn status` distinguishes a TLS trust failure from a dead server and no longer reads an all-cert-failure as "stopped" (#477, #481).
- `muninn.env` is loaded before every subcommand, so lifecycle/status commands share the daemon's config (#476).
- Activity chart buckets by the viewer's local calendar day (#458).
- `go` directive bumped to 1.26.4 to clear govulncheck stdlib advisories (#464).

### Fixed
- **HNSW graph integrity** — link-before-promote, distance-based neighbor pruning, vault-scoped index load, and back-edge persistence; repairs silent degradation of semantic recall to a single reachable cluster (#471, also resolves #462).
- `Evolve` no longer appends ` (evolved)` to the concept; lineage stays in the supersedes graph (#459).
- Renamed-vault correctness — bulk vault operations and FTS reindex resolve the stored workspace prefix instead of the SipHash of the current name (#454, #480).
- Consolidation dedup no longer mutates the cache-shared representative engram in place — was a data race against concurrent recalls (#492).
- Decay/recency scoring clamps clock skew — a future `LastAccess`/`CreatedAt` no longer pushes retention above 1 (#493).
- Memory detail panel "Created: Invalid Date" for search results (#461).

### Internal
- `storage.ErrNotFound` sentinel replaces `strings.Contains(err, "not found")` matching at the engine boundary (#491).
- De-flaked the WAL syncer timing tests (#486).

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- `fix(cluster)` — defer the `OnLobeJoined` callback until the `JoinResponse` + snapshot are fully on the wire, so the streamer no longer races the handshake and corrupts the lobe-side parser (#449, #448 Bug 1).
- `fix(cli)` — auto-detect TLS in `muninn status` / `muninn start` health probes (#444).

### Changed
- `feat(consolidation)` — the representative node absorbs the `AccessCount` of merged duplicates during dedup (#447).
- `feat(enrichment)` — Gemini 2.5 Flash added as a Google enrichment option and promoted to the default Google model (#450, #452).
- `chore(consolidation)` — dedup metadata-update errors are now surfaced in the consolidation report (#451).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Audit logging** — structured audit trail with file, stdout, syslog, and webhook sinks; `audit tail/export/stats` CLI commands (#418).
- **Retrieval annotations** — staleness, conflict, and trust metadata on recall responses (#388).
- **MCP `initialize` instructions** response.

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart worker goroutines after a panic; include the field byte in the BM25 posting key (multi-field terms were silently overwritten); scope the IDF cache per `(vault, term)` (#430).
- `fix(storage)` — vault deletion now clears all per-vault prefixes and entity-graph data and prunes orphaned global entity records (#435, #436, #438).
- `fix(cli)` — `muninn status` / `start` probes honour `MUNINNDB_{ADMIN,MCP,UI}_URL` (#439, #440).
- `fix(engine)` — content-hash dedup race, enrichment ghost-queue deadlock, trigger nil-metadata crash.
- `fix(auth)` — validate the Bearer token before parsing the body to prevent DoS amplification (#416).
- `fix(import)` — pipe deadlock and orphaned vault name on a failed import (#412).

### Security
- gRPC bumped to v1.79.3; govulncheck added to CI.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart FTS worker goroutines after a panic (a panicked worker was never replaced, eventually making all new writes unsearchable until restart); include the field byte in the BM25 posting key; scope the IDF cache by `(vault, term)` (#430).

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Per-engram trust/taint labels** (#387) — `TrustLevel` (`verified`/`inferred`/`external`/`untrusted`) stored at a fixed ERF offset (zero-migration); all writes auto-stamp `inferred`; trust is visible in `muninn_read`/`muninn_recall`; new `muninn_trust` MCP tool; `ExcludeUntrusted` per-vault plasticity option.
- **Cursor pagination** for `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` so large vaults no longer miss candidates (#362).

### Fixed
- `fix(engine)` — 400 for invalid inline association target IDs (#399).
- `fix(rest)` — 400 instead of 500 for invalid engram IDs in `/api/link` (#395).
- `fix(enrich)` — prevent infinite retry loops that deadlocked the circuit breaker (#390).
- `fix(trigger)` — guard against nil metadata in `sweepVault` / `handleCognitive` (#393).
- `fix(activation)` — restore the RRF score for BFS-traversed candidates in the ACT-R/CGDN paths.
- `fix(rest)` — delete phantom vaults that existed only in auth config.

### Internal
- `refactor(auth)` — extract `ParseBearerToken`, `ValidateStaticToken`, `IsValidVaultName` into the shared `internal/auth` package.

---

## [0.4.12-alpha] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **MCP vault-isolation bypass** — `mk_` vault-scoped keys now enforce vault pinning in open-server mode (no static token); previously any MCP caller could reach any vault by naming it. Invalid/revoked `mk_` keys fail closed; SSE message-endpoint auth re-validation tightened (#368).

---

## [0.4.11-alpha] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** — Hebbian associations strengthen over repeated co-activation; configurable via plasticity config.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** scoring strategy, selectable alongside ACT-R and Ebbinghaus.
- **Content-hash deduplication** at write time.
- **Agent-managed enrichment via MCP** — `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` / `muninn_apply_enrichment`.
- **`X-Client-Name: MuninnDB`** header on outbound LLM (embed/enrich) requests.

### Fixed
- **Cluster join handshake (4 bugs)** — register the live `net.Conn` before responding; remove the epoch guard so a Cortex restart re-triggers election; accept both `secret` and `cluster_secret` JSON fields; honour `MUNINN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` at bootstrap.

---

## [0.4.10] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Dashboard activity panel overhaul: selectable timeframe presets (7d–180d, capped at 180 days), end-date picker, dynamic x-axis tick grouping based on chart width, and a raw data table toggle with copy-to-clipboard. Includes loading, error, and empty-state feedback.
- `GET /api/activity-counts` endpoint returning per-day engram creation counts for a vault. Accepts `days` (1–180, default 7) and optional `until` (YYYY-MM-DD) query parameters. Malformed or out-of-range values return 400. Backed by an efficient ULID key-header scan with zero-filled contiguous day ranges.

### Changed
- Web UI: unified tab navigation across Memories, Graph, and Settings pages with a consistent bordered-tab style replacing the previous mix of underline, button, and pill patterns.
- Public vault unauthenticated access now runs in `full` mode. Previously, requests to an open vault with no API key ran as `observe`, silently preventing cognitive-state writes. Public vaults are now genuinely open — callers get `full` access unless they present an explicit `observe` key.

### Fixed
- Native `<select>` dropdowns unreadable in dark mode — `--bg-card` CSS variable was referenced but never defined; added it to both themes and added global select/option styling for proper dark/light rendering.
- Sidebar nav items are now scrollable when viewport height is too small, keeping the logo and footer pinned.
- Collapsed sidebar footer icons no longer overflow into the right border; icons render borderless when collapsed and bordered when expanded.
- "New Vault" action moved from sidebar footer into the vault picker modal to reclaim vertical space for nav items.
- Sidebar footer icons (theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts) replaced with consistent SVG icons matching the existing icon family.
- Version label merged into the footer icon row instead of occupying its own line.
- Sidebar footer padding and gaps tightened to maximize nav item visibility on short viewports.
- Memories page search-mode segmented control (Balanced/Semantic/Recent/Deep) now matches adjacent button height and font size, includes dividers between options, and preserves padding when Alpine.js re-renders dynamic styles.
- Enrich now accepts OpenAI-compatible JSON responses returned in `message.reasoning` when `message.content` is empty, including structured reasoning payloads.
- Retry and retroactive enrichment now only mark entity and relationship stages complete after successful persistence, avoiding partial-state retries, nil-result crashes, and silent graph-write failures.
- Entity and relationship response parsing now rejects nested wrapper keys like `meta.entities` / `meta.relationships` instead of treating them as valid empty results.
- Vault-scoped REST routes now resolve non-default vaults consistently from authenticated request bodies as well as `?vault=`, and reject mismatched query/body vaults.
- Vault-scoped REST routes are setup to deprecate vault passed in the body in a later release.
- REST read responses now include `memory_type: 0` for fact-classified memories instead of omitting the field.
- Observe-mode API keys now return `403` on semantically mutating REST and gRPC routes while preserving access to read-like POST endpoints such as activation, traversal, explanation, and batch link reads.
- ACT-R scoring: `bLevelCap` prevents base-level saturation in fresh vaults; two-pass per-query normalization ensures scores stay in [0, 1] range.
- Archived engrams (dream engine) now filtered at all retrieval points — query, find-by-entity, trigger worker sweeps.
- Dormant flag now gated on `!UseACTR`; in ACT-R mode the flag is derived from activation score rather than the Ebbinghaus relevance field.
- Web UI: form class consistency, segmented control hover state, uniform input/button sizing, memory filter bar density, page title branding, logs page full-width layout, observability view hash routing.
- SSE keepalive uses spec-compliant comment frame (`: keepalive`) to prevent proxy idle timeouts.
- Entity type allowlist expanded from 8 to 14 types; unknown types pass through without coercion.
- Clipboard API guarded by secure-context check with `execCommand` fallback for HTTP installs.
- Pebble `ErrNotFound` distinguished from other errors in embed migration path.

---

- Session click fetches full engram data + updates URL hash
- Atomic auth config rename (Pebble batch instead of separate Set+Delete)
