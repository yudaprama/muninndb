## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-20

Adds an agent-oriented credential and multi-agent workflow layer (capability
tokens and self-provisioned workflow vaults), a `working` plasticity preset,
recall-event calibration ground truth, and a `muninn remember` CLI write verb,
alongside a keyspace-collision fix that ships a one-time on-disk migration.

> **Upgrade note — on-disk migration.** This release relocates the auth
> subsystem's internal Pebble key prefixes to resolve a latent collision with
> storage keys (#611). A one-time v3 migration rewrites existing admin-user,
> API-key, and vault-config records on the first start after upgrade. It is
> idempotent and crash-safe, but **back up your data directory before
> upgrading**, as with any storage-format change. No action is needed beyond
> starting the new binary.

### Added

- **Capability tokens (`cap_`) and agent-provisioned workflow vaults.** A new
  TTL-bound, MCP-only credential type plus a `muninn_create_workflow_vault` tool
  that lets an agent mint a scoped, expiring `wf-*` vault for a fleet.
  Capabilities are structurally non-recursive (a capability can never mint
  another) and the tool is opt-in (`MUNINN_AGENT_VAULT_CREATE`, default off).
  (#612, RFC #597)
- **Toolset profiles for `tools/list`.** A `core`/`full` switch via the
  `MUNINN_MCP_TOOLSET` env var or a per-connection `X-Muninn-Toolset` header
  trims the advertised tool set to cut per-session schema overhead. Advertisement
  only — every tool stays callable. Defaults to `full`, fails open on unknown
  values. (#604, implements #588)
- **`working` plasticity preset.** `default` cognition (Hebbian + PAS on) plus a
  7-day retention window, so a shared workflow vault auto-evaporates through the
  background pruner. (#599, RFC #597)
- **Recall-event sink.** The set of engrams surfaced by each recall is persisted
  as calibration ground truth, behind a purpose-gated read allowlist so it can
  never leak back into recall, replicated like every other write, and cleared
  with its vault. (#574, closes #573)
- **`muninn remember` CLI verb.** Store a memory against a running daemon over
  the REST surface, with `--content-file` for large or JSON-fragile payloads,
  authenticating from a `0600` key file. (#613, closes #610)
- **Stored memory type surfaced on reads.** `read`, `recall`, `where_left_off`,
  and `find_by_entity` now return the stored `memory_type` and `type_label`.
  (#616)
- **Search Scoring setting** in the management console. (#590)

### Changed

- **Auth Pebble key prefixes relocated (`0x11`–`0x14` → `0x42`–`0x45`),**
  resolving a latent collision with storage keys in the shared database (see the
  upgrade note above). Ships a v3 on-disk migration and a cross-package
  prefix-disjointness test so the collision class can't recur. (#618, closes
  #611)

### Fixed

- **Tag-scoped recall no longer silently misses engrams.** `tags_all` /
  `tags_any` were post-filters over the candidate pool; they now seed candidates
  from the tag index, so a tagged engram can no longer be structurally absent
  from a tag-scoped recall. (#619, closes #607)
- **Revoked or expired `mk_` API keys can no longer keep dispatching on an open
  MCP SSE session.** The cached session credential is re-validated on every POST,
  symmetric with the existing `cap_` re-validation. (#617, RFC #597; see
  Security)
- **Late HNSW inserts stay reachable.** A node born with zero in-edges could be
  permanently unfindable; the fresh back-edge is now protected during prune and
  small orphan sets are repaired on load. (#621, closes #620)
- **Explicit recall threshold preserved under RRF fusion** instead of being
  clobbered to the RRF floor. (#590)
- **`DeleteEngram` serialized with `CompareAndSet`'s per-engram stripe lock,**
  closing a race that could resurrect a just-deleted engram. (#594)

### Security

- **Revoked `mk_` MCP SSE sessions closed.** A revoked or expired API key could
  keep serving a long-lived SSE session; it is now re-validated on every POST
  before dispatch. (#617)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Atomic compare-and-set + ownership lease on engrams.** A low-level CAS
  primitive (`PebbleStore.CompareAndSet`), layered into an advisory ownership
  lease (`Claim`/`Release`), giving a fleet of agents sharing a vault
  work-queue semantics — no two agents grab the same item. Closes a
  pre-existing lifecycle-state TOCTOU as a side effect. (#576, closes #548)
- **Fuzzy entity resolve behind exact `find_by_entity` lookup.** Exact match
  is tried first; fuzzy token-set-containment matching is the fallback, not
  the default, avoiding over-eager matches. (#571, #572, tightened in #581)
- **Vault dimension guard.** Each vault's embedding dimension is established
  atomically on first insert and enforced on every write path. On mismatch,
  recall degrades to BM25-only instead of silently mixing embedding spaces.
  (#589, closes #582)
- **User-supplied local ONNX embedding model.** New `embed_model_path` /
  `embed_tokenizer_path` config lets operators point at their own model
  instead of the bundled one; dimension is probed via real inference at
  init, never hardcoded. (#589, closes #583)
- **`vault plasticity` CLI command** to get/set per-vault plasticity
  settings. (#551)
- **`multi_user` vault setting** with shared-vault session-start guidance.
  (#575)
- **gRPC `ListVaults` and `BatchForget` RPCs**, with per-item vault
  resolution and auth requirements. (#557, #558)

### Fixed

- **Embed provider silent fallback eliminated.** An explicitly configured
  embed provider is never silently substituted for a different model. (#585)
- **BM25 fallback when the embed backend is unreachable**, with precise
  `-32602` error messages instead of an opaque failure. (#578)
- **Plasticity panel reset.** Advanced plasticity overrides no longer leak
  stale values into the save payload when the panel is collapsed. (#579)
- **CLI joined `exec:`/`logs:` tokens** now route to their handlers instead
  of being misparsed. (#580)
- **Idempotent write paths.** Idempotency keys are wired through gRPC and
  REST write paths and deduped within a batch. (#560, plus follow-up fix)
- **Entity scan dedup** by normalized identity instead of raw casing.
- **HNSW graph rebuild** from vectors when the restored structure is
  disconnected.
- **`vault create` registration** in the Pebble index, repairing a
  split-brain window in reindex-fts/export. (#547)
- **Google enrichment truncation.** The Google provider's `MaxOutputTokens`
  was raised from 4096 to 8192, and LLM parse failures are now counted in the
  stats, so long enrichments are no longer silently truncated.

### Security

- Bump Go toolchain to 1.26.5, fixing [GO-2026-5856](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5856)
  (Encrypted Client Hello privacy leak in `crypto/tls`), reachable via the gRPC
  server, MCP server, WAL recovery, `doctor` cert dial, and plugin transport.
  (#591)

> **Correction (see #602):** the originally-tagged 0.8.0 changelog listed an
> entity-boost recall-flood fix (#569) under Fixed. That fix did not make the
> 0.8.0 cut — #569 remains open and its PR (#570) is still in review — so the
> entry has been removed here. The fuzzy-entity work that did ship (#581) is
> covered under "Fuzzy entity resolve" above.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-12

The headline of this release is a complete overhaul of the cluster subsystem.
The Cortex/Lobe replication layer existed in previous releases but was not
reliably functional in real multi-node deployments. Every known correctness
issue has been addressed and Docker-validated end-to-end. High-availability
deployments are now production-ready.

### Added

- **Automatic failover.** When the Cortex goes down, Lobes detect SDOWN via
  gossip, accumulate votes, and the first node with quorum wins a jittered
  Raft-style election. Failover completes without operator intervention. (#532)
- **Returning-primary deference.** A restarted former Cortex probes the cluster
  before asserting leadership. If a failover leader is already in place, it
  defers, receives a snapshot, and follows — no split-brain, no data loss. (#537)
- **PeerHello discovery mesh.** Nodes with no join relationship (two primaries,
  sentinels) dial configured seeds and exchange authenticated `PeerHello` frames
  to establish identified connections, feeding MSP liveness and elections. (#530)
- **Equal-epoch tie-break.** When two primaries discover each other at the same
  epoch (split-brain bootstrap), the lower node-id keeps leadership and the
  other demotes cleanly. (#530)
- **Periodic quorum-loss self-demotion.** A Cortex that loses quorum demotes
  itself on a configurable interval. Recovery is automatic — once quorum is
  restored, it re-elects at a fresh epoch. Gated by a `hadQuorum` latch to
  prevent false demotion during bootstrap. (#527)
- **`muninn_evolve` concept rename.** The `concept` field is now an optional
  parameter. Omit to inherit the predecessor's label verbatim (existing
  behavior); supply a new string to rename it. Fixes the class of orientation
  bugs where a concept encoding mutable state ("answer owed", "PR blocked")
  could never be corrected without destroying the ULID lineage. (#483)
- **Server-side tag filters on recall.** `tags_all`, `tags_any`, and
  `tag_filter` (key-prefix + lexical bounds) are now first-class params on
  `muninn_recall`. Composes with semantic search and temporal filters. (#479)
- **SSE push re-evaluation on embed.** A `PushOnWrite` subscription that
  couldn't match at write time (vector score was 0, embedding not yet ready)
  is re-evaluated once the retroactive processor inserts the embedding. Fires
  exactly once; deduplicates against write-time deliveries. (#512)

### Fixed

- **Demotion zombie eliminated.** After demotion the Cortex goroutine previously
  parked at `<-ctx.Done()`, leaving the node in a half-leader state. Replaced
  with a supervisor state machine (`modeLeading / modeFollowing /
  modeWaitingQuorum`) that drives correct transitions. (#526)
- **Convergent failover election.** Stale connections from the old topology were
  not evicted after a failover, causing new join attempts to land on dead peers.
  Leader-gated joins, `ClearLeader` on ODOWN, and `EvictIfConn` on connection
  death bring the cluster to a stable single-leader state reliably. (#535, #536)
- **Lobe identity reconciliation on join.** A Lobe that reconnected under a
  different address was registered as a new member while the old entry persisted,
  inflating membership counts and breaking quorum calculations. (#524)
- **Voter count in `HandleVoteResponse`** — only registered voters counted,
  resolving phantom-voter quorum inflation. (#525)
- **Cluster topology in `/v1/cluster/info`** was reporting stale or incorrect
  member lists after topology changes. (#518)
- **Lobe replication stream.** A Lobe was closing the join connection
  immediately after handshake; the Cortex streams replication entries over the
  same connection, so the stream was immediately broken. (#515)
- **JoinRequest.Role HMAC coverage.** The join HMAC covered only `node_id`,
  leaving the `Role` field unauthenticated. Protocol v2 covers `nodeID + role`;
  v1 nodes remain accepted during rolling upgrades. (#539)

### Internal

- MSP `odownFired` latch prevents duplicate ODOWN callbacks per episode.
- `connKind` priority ordering (`kindJoin > kindHello > kindSeed`) prevents
  inferior connections from evicting established ones.
- TCP keepalive (15 s) set on all adopted peer connections.
- MBP protocol version bumped to 2.

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-11

Hotfix release for issues found in production immediately after v0.6.2. Every
fix ships with a regression test.

### Fixed
- **Multi-phrase semantic recall returned 0 results.** For a `context` of 2+
  phrases, the query embedding was the flat N×dim concatenation of the
  per-phrase vectors, fed to the dim-sized HNSW index — so the cosine length
  guard zeroed every score. The query embedding is now mean-pooled into a single
  dim-sized vector. Single-phrase recall was unaffected. (#498)
- **`merge_entity` on case-variant names destroyed engram links.** Entity names
  are hashed case-insensitively, so merging "Foo" into "foo" made source and
  target the same key; the relink batch's Set+Delete then silently removed the
  link to both casings. Now guarded at both the merge and relink layers. (#503)
- **SSE push events were never delivered to SDK clients.** The server read
  `on_write` while all SDKs send `push_on_write`; the status recorder also
  lacked `Unwrap()`, killing SSE streams at the write deadline. Both fixed, plus
  the Python SDK now parses the nested `engram` push payload. (#437)
- **Inline-enriched memories were reported as un-enriched forever.**
  Caller-supplied summary/relationships/type now set the matching digest flags,
  so the enrichment-candidates query no longer returns them. (#500)
- **HNSW: a failed index load was cached as a permanently empty index.** The
  load is now retried on the next access; load outcomes are logged; the restore
  iterator is scoped to the vault. (#499)
- **`muninn_recall` serialization.** `content` no longer duplicates `summary`,
  lifecycle `state` is populated, and scores no longer carry float32 noise. (#502)
- **Local embedder mislabeled.** It was labeled `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` but is
  `bge-small-en-v1.5`; additionally the Windows release binary shipped MiniLM
  bytes under BGE pooling. Both corrected. (#455)
- **Failed LLM-enrichment init now surfaces the real error** instead of
  reporting only "Not configured". (#453)
- **Entity-type validation is now consistent** across `remember`,
  `entity_state`, and `apply_enrichment` (normalize + coerce on every
  user-facing path). (#501)

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-10

### Security
- **Vault isolation on the binary transports** — MBP (8474) and gRPC (8477) now enforce the same fail-closed vault model as REST/MCP: a keyed session is pinned to its key's vault (cross-vault access rejected, even to a public vault), an unauthenticated session may reach only public vaults, and a missing auth store fails closed (#484).
- **LLM provider API keys masked** in the admin plugin-config API; a retyped key is saved, an untouched (masked) field is preserved (#488).
- **Installer checksum verification** — releases now publish `checksums.txt`; `install.sh` / `install.ps1` verify the downloaded binary and refuse to install on mismatch (#489).
- **Startup warning** when bound to a non-loopback address while the admin still has the default password (#490).

### Added
- TLS is now a first-class mode (epic #443): TLS setup in `muninn init` (#465), `muninn doctor` self-describes TLS state / bind addresses / cert details (#463), startup cert-expiry warning (#456), `docs/tls.md` + TLS-aware systemd unit (#466), Web UI host derived from the cert DNS SAN (#467).

### Changed
- Scheme-aware CLI URLs and clients throughout — printed URLs, generated AI-tool configs, and admin/vault HTTP clients honour `https` under TLS (#468, #469, #478); `muninn status` distinguishes a TLS trust failure from a dead server and no longer reads an all-cert-failure as "stopped" (#477, #481).
- `muninn.env` is loaded before every subcommand, so lifecycle/status commands share the daemon's config (#476).
- Activity chart buckets by the viewer's local calendar day (#458).
- `go` directive bumped to 1.26.4 to clear govulncheck stdlib advisories (#464).

### Fixed
- **HNSW graph integrity** — link-before-promote, distance-based neighbor pruning, vault-scoped index load, and back-edge persistence; repairs silent degradation of semantic recall to a single reachable cluster (#471, also resolves #462).
- `Evolve` no longer appends ` (evolved)` to the concept; lineage stays in the supersedes graph (#459).
- Renamed-vault correctness — bulk vault operations and FTS reindex resolve the stored workspace prefix instead of the SipHash of the current name (#454, #480).
- Consolidation dedup no longer mutates the cache-shared representative engram in place — was a data race against concurrent recalls (#492).
- Decay/recency scoring clamps clock skew — a future `LastAccess`/`CreatedAt` no longer pushes retention above 1 (#493).
- Memory detail panel "Created: Invalid Date" for search results (#461).

### Internal
- `storage.ErrNotFound` sentinel replaces `strings.Contains(err, "not found")` matching at the engine boundary (#491).
- De-flaked the WAL syncer timing tests (#486).

### Upgrade notes
- The HNSW fix (#471) repairs the indexing algorithm but not graphs already degraded on disk by the old defects. If semantic recall has been returning too few results, run one `muninn vault reembed <vault>` per affected vault on this build to rebuild a correct graph.

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- `fix(cluster)` — defer the `OnLobeJoined` callback until the `JoinResponse` + snapshot are fully on the wire, so the streamer no longer races the handshake and corrupts the lobe-side parser (#449, #448 Bug 1).
- `fix(cli)` — auto-detect TLS in `muninn status` / `muninn start` health probes (#444).

### Changed
- `feat(consolidation)` — the representative node absorbs the `AccessCount` of merged duplicates during dedup (#447).
- `feat(enrichment)` — Gemini 2.5 Flash added as a Google enrichment option and promoted to the default Google model (#450, #452).
- `chore(consolidation)` — dedup metadata-update errors are now surfaced in the consolidation report (#451).

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Audit logging** — structured audit trail with file, stdout, syslog, and webhook sinks; `audit tail/export/stats` CLI commands (#418).
- **Retrieval annotations** — staleness, conflict, and trust metadata on recall responses (#388).
- **MCP `initialize` instructions** response.

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart worker goroutines after a panic; include the field byte in the BM25 posting key (multi-field terms were silently overwritten); scope the IDF cache per `(vault, term)` (#430).
- `fix(storage)` — vault deletion now clears all per-vault prefixes and entity-graph data and prunes orphaned global entity records (#435, #436, #438).
- `fix(cli)` — `muninn status` / `start` probes honour `MUNINNDB_{ADMIN,MCP,UI}_URL` (#439, #440).
- `fix(engine)` — content-hash dedup race, enrichment ghost-queue deadlock, trigger nil-metadata crash.
- `fix(auth)` — validate the Bearer token before parsing the body to prevent DoS amplification (#416).
- `fix(import)` — pipe deadlock and orphaned vault name on a failed import (#412).

### Security
- gRPC bumped to v1.79.3; govulncheck added to CI.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `fix(fts)` — auto-restart FTS worker goroutines after a panic (a panicked worker was never replaced, eventually making all new writes unsearchable until restart); include the field byte in the BM25 posting key; scope the IDF cache by `(vault, term)` (#430).

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Per-engram trust/taint labels** (#387) — `TrustLevel` (`verified`/`inferred`/`external`/`untrusted`) stored at a fixed ERF offset (zero-migration); all writes auto-stamp `inferred`; trust is visible in `muninn_read`/`muninn_recall`; new `muninn_trust` MCP tool; `ExcludeUntrusted` per-vault plasticity option.
- **Cursor pagination** for `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` so large vaults no longer miss candidates (#362).

### Fixed
- `fix(engine)` — 400 for invalid inline association target IDs (#399).
- `fix(rest)` — 400 instead of 500 for invalid engram IDs in `/api/link` (#395).
- `fix(enrich)` — prevent infinite retry loops that deadlocked the circuit breaker (#390).
- `fix(trigger)` — guard against nil metadata in `sweepVault` / `handleCognitive` (#393).
- `fix(activation)` — restore the RRF score for BFS-traversed candidates in the ACT-R/CGDN paths.
- `fix(rest)` — delete phantom vaults that existed only in auth config.

### Internal
- `refactor(auth)` — extract `ParseBearerToken`, `ValidateStaticToken`, `IsValidVaultName` into the shared `internal/auth` package.

---

## [0.4.12-alpha] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **MCP vault-isolation bypass** — `mk_` vault-scoped keys now enforce vault pinning in open-server mode (no static token); previously any MCP caller could reach any vault by naming it. Invalid/revoked `mk_` keys fail closed; SSE message-endpoint auth re-validation tightened (#368).

---

## [0.4.11-alpha] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** — Hebbian associations strengthen over repeated co-activation; configurable via plasticity config.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** scoring strategy, selectable alongside ACT-R and Ebbinghaus.
- **Content-hash deduplication** at write time.
- **Agent-managed enrichment via MCP** — `muninn_get_enrichment_candidates` / `muninn_apply_enrichment`.
- **`X-Client-Name: MuninnDB`** header on outbound LLM (embed/enrich) requests.

### Fixed
- **Cluster join handshake (4 bugs)** — register the live `net.Conn` before responding; remove the epoch guard so a Cortex restart re-triggers election; accept both `secret` and `cluster_secret` JSON fields; honour `MUNINN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` at bootstrap.

---

## [0.4.10] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Dashboard activity panel overhaul: selectable timeframe presets (7d–180d, capped at 180 days), end-date picker, dynamic x-axis tick grouping based on chart width, and a raw data table toggle with copy-to-clipboard. Includes loading, error, and empty-state feedback.
- `GET /api/activity-counts` endpoint returning per-day engram creation counts for a vault. Accepts `days` (1–180, default 7) and optional `until` (YYYY-MM-DD) query parameters. Malformed or out-of-range values return 400. Backed by an efficient ULID key-header scan with zero-filled contiguous day ranges.

### Changed
- Web UI: unified tab navigation across Memories, Graph, and Settings pages with a consistent bordered-tab style replacing the previous mix of underline, button, and pill patterns.
- Public vault unauthenticated access now runs in `full` mode. Previously, requests to an open vault with no API key ran as `observe`, silently preventing cognitive-state writes. Public vaults are now genuinely open — callers get `full` access unless they present an explicit `observe` key.

### Fixed
- Native `<select>` dropdowns unreadable in dark mode — `--bg-card` CSS variable was referenced but never defined; added it to both themes and added global select/option styling for proper dark/light rendering.
- Sidebar nav items are now scrollable when viewport height is too small, keeping the logo and footer pinned.
- Collapsed sidebar footer icons no longer overflow into the right border; icons render borderless when collapsed and bordered when expanded.
- "New Vault" action moved from sidebar footer into the vault picker modal to reclaim vertical space for nav items.
- Sidebar footer icons (theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts) replaced with consistent SVG icons matching the existing icon family.
- Version label merged into the footer icon row instead of occupying its own line.
- Sidebar footer padding and gaps tightened to maximize nav item visibility on short viewports.
- Memories page search-mode segmented control (Balanced/Semantic/Recent/Deep) now matches adjacent button height and font size, includes dividers between options, and preserves padding when Alpine.js re-renders dynamic styles.
- Enrich now accepts OpenAI-compatible JSON responses returned in `message.reasoning` when `message.content` is empty, including structured reasoning payloads.
- Retry and retroactive enrichment now only mark entity and relationship stages complete after successful persistence, avoiding partial-state retries, nil-result crashes, and silent graph-write failures.
- Entity and relationship response parsing now rejects nested wrapper keys like `meta.entities` / `meta.relationships` instead of treating them as valid empty results.
- Vault-scoped REST routes now resolve non-default vaults consistently from authenticated request bodies as well as `?vault=`, and reject mismatched query/body vaults.
- Vault-scoped REST routes are setup to deprecate vault passed in the body in a later release.
- REST read responses now include `memory_type: 0` for fact-classified memories instead of omitting the field.
- Observe-mode API keys now return `403` on semantically mutating REST and gRPC routes while preserving access to read-like POST endpoints such as activation, traversal, explanation, and batch link reads.
- ACT-R scoring: `bLevelCap` prevents base-level saturation in fresh vaults; two-pass per-query normalization ensures scores stay in [0, 1] range.
- Archived engrams (dream engine) now filtered at all retrieval points — query, find-by-entity, trigger worker sweeps.
- Dormant flag now gated on `!UseACTR`; in ACT-R mode the flag is derived from activation score rather than the Ebbinghaus relevance field.
- Web UI: form class consistency, segmented control hover state, uniform input/button sizing, memory filter bar density, page title branding, logs page full-width layout, observability view hash routing.
- SSE keepalive uses spec-compliant comment frame (`: keepalive`) to prevent proxy idle timeouts.
- Entity type allowlist expanded from 8 to 14 types; unknown types pass through without coercion.
- Clipboard API guarded by secure-context check with `execCommand` fallback for HTTP installs.
- Pebble `ErrNotFound` distinguished from other errors in embed migration path.

---

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Native TLS support via `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` flags on all 5 client-facing servers
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec served at `GET /api/openapi.yaml` (60+ routes documented)
- API key TTL — optional `expires` field on key creation (`"90d"`, `"1y"`, RFC3339)
- Query timeout enforcement — 30s activation deadline with BFS short-circuit (`MUNINN_ACTIVATE_TIMEOUT`)
- Automated backup scheduler (`--backup-interval`, `--backup-dir`, `--backup-retain`)
- Vault rename — metadata-only rename across storage, engine, REST, CLI, and Web UI
- Contradiction resolution — Keep A, Keep B, Merge, Dismiss actions in Web UI
- CLI: `muninn vault create`, `muninn api-key create|list|revoke`, `muninn admin change-password`
- Web UI: engram edit/evolve, new vault creation, manual link/association creation

- Web UI: explain scores ("Why?" button), consolidate, record decision modals
- Web UI: memory filtering and sorting (created/accessed, tags, state, confidence, date range)
- Web UI: keyboard shortcuts (`/` search, `n` new, `?` help), tooltips, prev/next navigation
- Web UI: per-engram embedding status indicator, API key expiry column, backup trigger
- Graph: orphan node filtering, zoom controls (+/−/Fit)
- Observability tab in Web UI with live polling
- `GET /api/admin/observability` REST endpoint with full system snapshot
- Per-vault latency tracker with percentile reporting (p50/p95/p99)
- Vault-labeled Prometheus histograms for write/activate/read latency

- Branch protection on main (PR + approval + CI) and develop (CI)
- Node SDK publish workflow (OIDC trusted publishing)
- Patent notice (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/991,402)

### Fixed
- ListEngrams now uses passive Pebble scan — no Hebbian side effects on browse
- Explain runs in observe mode — no cognitive mutations on "Why?" clicks
- Session click fetches full engram data + updates URL hash
- Atomic auth config rename (Pebble batch instead of separate Set+Delete)
- Sentinel error `ErrVaultNameCollision` replaces fragile string matching across clone/import/rename
- `parseKeyExpiry` rejects past dates at creation time
- Backup test data race (atomic counter for stubCheckpointer)
- Windowed average calculation in latency tracker
- Unconditional Prometheus metric recording and reembed vault response handling
- MCP vault default fix

---

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- `bge-small-en-v1.5` embedder support as an alternative to the default ONNX embedder
- Recall mode presets exposed in CLI, REST, and Web UI

### Fixed
- Arrow key navigation in the `init` wizard multi-select and single-select prompts

---

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Hebbian edge pruning — low-weight associative edges are automatically pruned over time
- Activation snapshot isolation so snapshots cannot observe mid-propagation state
