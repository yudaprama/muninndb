# Access & Authentication

MuninnDB uses a two-layer auth model. The layers are separate because they serve different actors with different needs.

---

## Why this is different from other databases

In every traditional database, **reads are transparent**. A `SELECT` in Postgres doesn't modify row weights. A `GET` in Redis doesn't affect TTLs. You can give someone read access and be certain that their queries won't alter the data landscape for anyone else.

In MuninnDB, **reads are not transparent**. When you activate a memory:

- Its access count increases, which raises its stability score
- The Hebbian weights between co-activated engrams strengthen
- Its temporal score refreshes — it becomes "recent" again
- RRF fusion scores shift for the next retrieval by anyone in that vault

This is the cognitive model working correctly. A brain that remembers something is not the same brain it was before. But it means that a careless read-only consumer can silently reshape the vault's learned relevance for every other user.

The auth model is designed around this reality.

---

## Layer 1 — Admin credentials

Admin users access the system operator layer: the web UI, the shell (`muninn shell`), and vault management endpoints. They do not normally interact with vault data directly — that is what API keys are for.

**First run:** MuninnDB prints a generated root password on the first startup. Save it. Change it via the web UI afterward. The password is never printed again.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         MuninnDB — First Run Auth        │
│                                          │
│  Admin username: root                    │
│  Admin password: xK9mP2nQ4rT7wY1aZb3c   │
│                                          │
│  Change this password after first login. │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Admin credentials authenticate to:
- **Web UI** — session cookie, 24-hour TTL
- **Shell** — prompted at `muninn shell`, no session stored

---

## Layer 2 — Vault API keys

A vault is either **open** (no API key required) or **locked** (API key required). The built-in `default` vault ships **open** out of the box so that any MCP client can connect without configuration. Additional vaults you create start locked and must be explicitly opened.

Open vault requests currently run in `full` mode unless a caller presents a different API key. Use an `observe` key when you need read access without cognitive-state writes.

A vault can have multiple API keys — one per integration point. You might have:

```
vault: default
  mk_abc...  label: "ai-agent"         mode: full
  mk_def...  label: "analytics-dash"   mode: observe
  mk_ghi...  label: "backup-exporter"  mode: observe
```

### Key modes

| Mode | Reads | Cognitive state writes | Use case |
|------|-------|------------------------|----------|
| `full` | Yes | **Yes** — temporal scores refresh, Hebbian weights update, access counts increment | AI agents, primary integrations, anything that is *part of* the brain |
| `observe` | Yes | **No** — mutating REST routes and gRPC RPCs return `403` before the engine is reached, and on MCP every tool classified mutating is refused at dispatch; engine-layer cognitive mutations are also suppressed | Dashboards, analytics, read-only partners, exports |

The `observe` mode exists because the vault's cognitive state is the thing of value. A dashboard reading engrams 1000 times a day should not inflate access counts and distort what the AI agent sees as relevant. `observe` keys see the brain; they don't affect it, and semantically mutating REST routes are rejected.

### Key format

```
mk_xK9mP2nQ4rT7wY1aZb3cD5eF6gH7iJ8kL9m
│  └─────────────────────────────────────── 32 random bytes, base64url encoded
└── prefix identifies MuninnDB API keys
```

Keys are 46 characters. The raw bytes are generated with `crypto/rand`. The token itself is the credential — MuninnDB stores only a SHA-256 hash of the raw bytes, so a compromised database file does not expose valid tokens.

**Tokens are shown once at creation and never again.** Copy them immediately.

### Using a key

Include the key as a bearer token on every request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/engrams?vault=default \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_xK9m..."
```

The key implicitly identifies the vault. If the key belongs to `default` and the request specifies a different vault, the request is rejected.
For body-based REST routes, the vault must be supplied as `?vault=`. Some routes allow vault to be in the JSON body for compatibility but this will be deprecated soon. If both are present, they must match.

---

## Workflow capabilities (`cap_`)

Capabilities are a second vault credential type, designed for **short-lived, scoped access** in agentic workflows. Where an `mk_` key is a long-lived integration credential you create and rotate by hand, a `cap_` token is minted programmatically, carries a mandatory expiry, and cannot escalate its own privileges.

| | `mk_` API key | `cap_` capability |
|---|---|---|
| Lifetime | Long-lived, until revoked | **TTL-bound** (default 168h / 7d) |
| Created by | Admin, via the admin API | `muninn_create_workflow_vault` tool, programmatically |
| Can mint vaults? | Yes (with `full` mode + opt-in) | **No** — structural recursion guard |
| Auth identity | `IsAPIKey` | `IsCapability` |
| Mode-enforced | Yes (`full` / `observe` / `write`) | Yes — same guards |

### Capability format

```
cap_xK9mP2nQ4rT7wY1aZb3cD5eF6gH7iJ8kL9m
│   └─────────────────────────────────── 32 random bytes, base64url encoded
└── prefix identifies MuninnDB capabilities
```

Like `mk_` keys, the raw bytes are generated with `crypto/rand` and only a SHA-256 hash is persisted — the token itself is the credential. The defining difference is the mandatory `ExpiresAt`: a capability with no TTL is refused at mint time.

### How capabilities authenticate

A `cap_` token resolves to `IsCapability=true`, distinct from `IsAPIKey`. This distinction is load-bearing:

- **Mode-enforced identically.** A `full` cap can mutate cognitive state; an `observe` cap cannot — the same `ReadOnlyGuard` / `denyReadOnlyMutation` paths apply.
- **Rejected at the privileged tool boundary.** `muninn_create_workflow_vault` requires `IsAPIKey && full`. Because capabilities authenticate as `IsCapability`, they are rejected at dispatch. Recursion is structurally impossible, not merely policy.

**MCP-only authentication.** `cap_` tokens are resolved on **MCP transports only** (stdio, SSE, HTTP-streamable). The REST (port 8475) and gRPC transports call only `ValidateAPIKey`, so they accept `mk_` keys but **not** `cap_` tokens — a `cap_` bearer on REST/gRPC is rejected as an invalid key. Use `mk_` keys to drive those transports, or reach the vault over MCP with the `cap_` token.

### Minting capabilities — `muninn_create_workflow_vault`

The MCP tool `muninn_create_workflow_vault` creates a workflow vault and mints a full-mode capability for it in one call. It is **opt-in and off by default**.

**Opt-in (operator):**

```bash
export MUNINN_AGENT_VAULT_CREATE=1
```

When unset (or any value other than `1`), the tool returns `forbidden: agent vault creation disabled` even if the caller holds a valid full-mode `mk_` key. The caller must also be an `mk_` key in `full` mode — a `cap_` bearer is rejected by the recursion guard.

**Call (MCP):**

```json
{
  "name": "wf-acme-sprint",
  "label": "acme-worker",
  "ttl_hours": 168
}
```

| Arg | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `name` | auto `wf-<8hex>` | 1-64 lowercase alphanumeric / hyphen / underscore |
| `label` | `agent-minted` | Stamped on the capability for audit and listing |
| `ttl_hours` | `168` (7 days) | Matches the `working` preset's 7-day retention |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "vault": "wf-acme-sprint",
  "capability_id": "A1B2C3D4",
  "capability_secret": "cap_xK9m...",
  "mode": "full",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-23T12:19:21Z",
  "auto_evap_days": 7,
  "warning": "capability_secret is shown once; distribute it to worker agents. The vault auto-evaporates engrams after 7 days."
}
```

The vault is created with the `working` preset (default cognition + 7-day auto-evaporation) and `multi_user` enabled, so the agent guide steers worker agents toward per-user-scoped recall. `capability_secret` is returned **once** — distribute it to worker agents out-of-band.

### TTL configuration

- **Per-call:** the `ttl_hours` arg (default `168`).
- **Operator-wide ceiling:** `MUNINN_WORKFLOW_CAP_TTL_HOURS` clamps the per-call value — when set, a caller's `ttl_hours` is honored only up to this fleet-wide maximum, and any larger request is capped.

### Security notes

- **Bearer token.** A `cap_` is a bearer credential — anyone holding it can access the vault at its mode until it expires or is revoked. The TTL bounds exposure if a token leaks via logs or transcripts; it does not prevent the leak. Distribute secrets out-of-band and never log them.
- **Shown once.** `capability_secret` appears in the MCP response and never again. The store holds only a SHA-256 hash.
- **Recursion-proof by construction.** The privileged tool checks `IsAPIKey && full` at dispatch. Capabilities authenticate as `IsCapability` and cannot satisfy that check, so no capability can mint another capability — a leaked `cap_` cannot spiral into unauthorized vault creation.

## Managing keys

### Create a key (admin only)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vault": "default",
    "label": "my-agent",
    "mode": "full"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "mk_xK9m...",
  "key": {
    "id": "A1B2C3D4",
    "vault": "default",
    "label": "my-agent",
    "mode": "full",
    "created_at": "2026-02-20T..."
  }
}
```

### List keys for a vault

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/keys?vault=default"
```

Token values are not returned. You see the key metadata (ID, label, mode, created date) only.

### Revoke a key

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/keys/A1B2C3D4?vault=default"
```

Revocation is immediate. The token stops working on the next request.

---

## Vault configuration

### Vault access control

The `default` vault is created as **public** on first run — no API key required. Any additional vault you create starts locked (fail-closed) until you explicitly open it.

To open a vault (allow unauthenticated access):

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/vaults/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"myvault","public":true}'
```

To lock a vault (require an API key):

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/vaults/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"default","public":false}'
```

**Any vault without an explicit config requires an API key.** Only the `default` vault is pre-configured as public by Bootstrap.

### Per-vault plasticity configuration

Plasticity controls the cognitive pipeline for a vault — how it learns, forgets, and traverses connections between engrams. Each vault can have its own plasticity settings independent of others.

**Five preset profiles** are available: `default` (balanced Hebbian + temporal), `reference` (preserves with strong Hebbian bonds), `scratchpad` (rapid fading, minimal history), `knowledge-graph` (rich traversal, strong associative learning), and `working` (default cognition with 7-day auto-eviction for shared workflow scratch vaults; pair with `multi_user` per RFC #597).

Get the current plasticity configuration for a vault:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/vault/default/plasticity" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-session>"
```

Response includes both the saved configuration and the fully resolved values (preset merged with overrides):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "preset": "default",
    "hebbian_enabled": true,
    "temporal_halflife": 30
  },
  "resolved": {
    "hebbian_enabled": true,
    "temporal_enabled": true,
    "hop_depth": 2,
    "semantic_weight": 0.6,
    "fts_weight": 0.3,
    "relevance_floor": 0.05,
    "temporal_halflife": 30,
    "hebbian_weight": 0.5,
    "temporal_weight": 0.4,
    "recency_weight": 0.3,
    "traversal_profile": ""
  }
}
```

Update plasticity for a vault:

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8475/api/admin/vault/default/plasticity" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-session>" \
  -d '{
    "preset": "knowledge-graph",
    "temporal_halflife": 60,
    "traversal_profile": "causal"
  }'
```

**Configuration fields:**

| Field | Type | Range | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `preset` | string | `default` \| `reference` \| `scratchpad` \| `knowledge-graph` \| `working` | Base cognitive profile; overrides applied on top |
| `hebbian_enabled` | bool | — | Enable/disable Hebbian co-activation learning. Symmetric (COG-32): gates weight updates, association decay, **and** the read-side boost recall applies from association weights |
| `temporal_enabled` | bool | — | Enable/disable time-based temporal scoring |
| `multi_user` | bool | — | Vault shared by multiple users/agents: guide + recall hints steer clients to per-user scoped recall; `where_left_off`/`session` flagged vault-global |
| `hop_depth` | int | 0–8 | BFS hops for associative retrieval; higher = broader context |
| `semantic_weight` | float | 0–1 | Multiplier for semantic similarity in fusion scoring |
| `fts_weight` | float | 0–1 | Multiplier for full-text keyword match scoring |
| `relevance_floor` | float | 0–1 | Minimum relevance score; prevents memories from becoming invisible |
| `temporal_halflife` | float | >0 | Days before an engram reaches half-life |
| `traversal_profile` | string | `default` \| `causal` \| `confirmatory` \| `adversarial` \| `structural` | Link traversal strategy; empty = auto-infer |
| `predictive_activation` | bool | — | Enable/disable Predictive Activation Signal (PAS); default: true |
| `pas_max_injections` | int | 1–20 | Max transition candidates injected per activation; default: 5 |

## The one brain principle

A vault is a single cognitive entity. All connections with `full` keys participate in that entity's learned state equally — there is no per-user relevance. The vault's access patterns, Hebbian weights, and temporal scores reflect the collective behavior of every `full` connection.

This is a deliberate design decision:

**Why not per-user cognitive state?**

If each user had their own relevance weights, the vault would have N brains instead of one. You'd lose the emergent collective intelligence — the thing that makes a shared knowledge base useful is that everyone's usage teaches the system what matters to the group. Per-user weights would also multiply storage requirements for every engram by the number of users.

**If you need isolation, use separate vaults.** A vault per service, per project, or per person gives you isolated cognitive states. Multiple keys into one vault gives you a shared brain with controlled access.

## Security properties

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Token storage | SHA-256 hash only — plaintext never persisted |
| Admin passwords | bcrypt with default cost |
| Session tokens | HMAC-SHA256 signed, 24h TTL, HttpOnly cookie |
| Transport | HTTP by default; serve TLS natively (see [tls.md](tls.md)) or behind a TLS-terminating proxy |
| Key revocation | Immediate, no grace period |
| Observe isolation | Enforced at both the transport layer (`ReadOnlyGuard` on REST, `denyReadOnlyMutation` on gRPC) and the engine activation layer — not just an honor system |
| Encryption at rest | Not built-in — use OS/volume encryption; see [self-hosting guide](self-hosting.md#encryption-at-rest) |
| Capability tokens | TTL-bound bearer; SHA-256 hash only (plaintext never persisted); recursion-guarded at dispatch — `IsAPIKey` is required to mint, so no `cap_` can mint another |

---

## Migration from unauthenticated installations

Existing vaults default to `public: true`. Nothing breaks. You add auth incrementally:

1. Admin user is created on first run with the new binary
2. All existing vaults continue to work without keys
3. Lock specific vaults by setting `public: false` via the admin API
4. Generate keys for your integrations
5. Update your integrations to include `Authorization: Bearer mk_...`

You can lock vaults one at a time while rolling out keys to your services.
